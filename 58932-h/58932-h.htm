  <h2 id='pro' class='c014'>PROLOGUE<br /> <br />HOW I CAME TO BE A TRAMP</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;BROUGHT myself up on Carlyle and found him
the dearest, gentlest, bravest, noblest man.
The Life by Froude was dearer to me than the
Gospel of St Matthew, or Hamlet, or Macbeth,
and that is saying much if the reader only knew me.
Carlyle was so near that I saw him in dreams and spoke
with him in words that were true, unquestionably. In
the vision world of my dream he behaved exactly as he
would have done in real life, I am sure of it. He was
flesh and blood to me. Yet he died and was buried
before I was born. How strange! This man who died
three years before I was born was a friend closer to me
than a lover, one to whom I longed to say caressing
words, one whom I longed to embrace and fondle—to
kiss even.</p>

<p class='c013'>He made me work, the dear, irascible, eloquent old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>sage. I worked at his bidding and set myself impossible
tasks—impossible! I became a puritan, serious, intolerant
and heroic; and in moments of rapture, conscious
of the silence of the stars and the graves, I would
sing to the night the marching song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here eyes do regard you</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In Eternity’s stillness,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Here is all fulness,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Ye brave, to reward you,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Work and despair not.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Carlyle was a true friend to me, he was not content
that he only should be my friend, I had to become the
friend of his friends. Now, I am one of the Great
Society of his friends. I belong to the fellowship of
those that have seen The City. The Great Society has
among its members many children and many jolly
tramps. Has the reader ever been introduced personally
to the Great Ones long since dead? I think these
literary men the great Friends of Mankind. They
allow themselves to be known and cherished—different
from military heroes or scientists or explorers. One
would as soon love a waxwork as Napoleon. Yet even
the despised and rejected of the literary world are warm
and smiling friends to their readers. I, for my part,
adored Ruskin and Browning as a young girl in love
with a new history mistress. I obeyed Ruskin, bought
his works in purple calf and looked up the long words
in the dictionary. Then Rabbi Ben Ezra entered into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>me so that I spoke with tongues. I learned the poem
by heart and recited it to sunsets. I ask myself now
how I reconciled “Work and despair not” with</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not on the vulgar mass,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Called work must sentence pass.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But of course both sentences are true; one is for one
nature, the other for another; I think I must have really
belonged to the second category, for have I not become
a tramp!</p>

<p class='c013'>I never felt so humanly close to Ruskin as to Carlyle.
He had a way of stating <i>the truth</i>. He liked to perch
on his truths and crow. No, I revered him, but decidedly
didn’t like him. Browning made friends with
me. Then came Ibsen; and both Browning and Ibsen
confirmed me in the heroism of achieving impossible
tasks. Has the reader seen the “Master Builder,” the
man who did the impossible twice? “It’s—fearfully
thrilling.” In these days I spouted: “Life is like
the compound eye of the fly. It is full of lives.
Momentarily we died, momentarily are born again.
The old self dies, the new is born; the old life gives way
to the new. The selfish man wishes to remain as he is;
in his life are fewer lives, fewer changes. But the hero
wishes to fulfil every promise written in his being. He
dies gladly in each moment to arise the next moment
more glorious, nearer to perfection. Oh, my friend,
pay for the new life with all the old. The life that thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>hast, was given thee for paying away so that thou
mightest obtain something better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In myself I believed these words. I worked and
read. I worked and threw myself at the impossible.
What Swinburne wrote is true:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A joy to the heart of a man</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Is a goal that he may not reach.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I wrote lectures in which my style was so infected
by the rhetoric of the sage that listeners grumbled that
they could not tell when I was quoting and when I was
using my own language. That was their defect; they
should have known Carlyle better! One lecture I
specially remember. It was given to some Essex folk.
It related to Hero-worship. All the artillery of Carlyle
was in play. It was a subject supremely Carlylean.
Work, I praised, and heroic valour. But my message
was: “In each of you there is a Hero, let him out; in
each man there is a Hero, see one there,” which is not
what Carlyle meant when he said: “Recognise the
Hero when you see him and obey.” This was, perhaps,
a first divergency. Carlyle was looking for a means to
govern a nation wisely. I was moving towards my
tramp destiny.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was in the year of the Russian Revolution and
I had been learning Russian very sedulously for some
time. A literary ambition had possession of me. I
had said to myself—one must specialise to get on in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>world of literature. Carlyle specialised German.
German things did not interest me. I had long since
learned to enjoy Turgeniev and Gorky and Gogol in
English translations, and Russia had become to me the
most interesting country in Europe. I determined to
specialise on Russia.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, and when, according to the newspapers, the
bombs were flying thick and fast, I took a return ticket
for Moscow and went out. For luggage I took a camera
and a small hand-bag. The tramp has the soberest conscience
about luggage. He feels he can always <i>do without</i>.
But, of course, I wasn’t a tramp then. I may
remark in passing that I lost none of that luggage and
had no trouble whatever with it. Few travellers
manage their first trip to Russia without vexatious
misadventures. On one occasion, however, when I was
taking a snap-shot of a prison, a soldier rushed up to me
in terror and rage. He thought my Kodak was a bomb.</p>

<p class='c013'>What an excitement this journey was! I had never
even been abroad before. Now I went through Holland
and across the whole of Germany and into Poland.
Two days after I had left England I was in Russia. I
arrived at Warsaw on the day the Governor was shot.
I saw at once there were more soldiers than people in
the streets. I took a droshky to a hotel, put down my
things and strolled out to see the city. I was arrested
at once. Fifty yards down Marzalkovsky, the Piccadilly
of Warsaw, a soldier stopped me, searched me and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>handed me over to an officer and six armed guards. I
was put in the middle and marched off; on each side
of me a soldier held a drawn sword and was ready to
slash at me if I should attempt to bolt. I am sure the
angels wept. Internally I collapsed with laughter and
at the same time I felt very rich. I was having an
experience.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was released and was arrested again, and a Circassian
guard punched me in the stomach very hard, “for
luck,” I think he said. They gave an account of my
arrest in the <i>Russ</i> and said I had been nearly beaten to
death, but they didn’t know who I was. Somehow it
came to England as the arrest and flogging of Mr Foster
Fraser, the well-known correspondent. Poor Mr
Fraser, it must have been awkward explaining to his
friends that it was not really he who was flogged.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was not a correspondent, but I wrote of my adventures,
and it was very pleasant to see my words printed
in London newspapers. It was very amusing to see myself
styled “Our own Special Correspondent,” when,
in truth, I was only a free lance and had not even seen
the face of a London editor. Journalism is a cheap
trade! At Warsaw I met correspondents of many
papers and had surprising glimpses behind the scenes.
There was a little American Jew there who knew almost
every language in Europe, who had an eye for every
nationality, and who knew the private history of all the
women of the city. At one time he had been hotel tout,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>interpreter, guide, but now was correspondent, reporter,
supplier of information. He was always hanging about
the chief hotel and watching for journalists hard up for
copy. There were crowds of English newspaper men
who could not speak intelligibly in French, far less in
Russian. To such the American was a god-send. And
Lord, what stories they wrote home to England!</p>

<p class='c013'>I left Warsaw for Moscow and Nizhni. When I left
the American was a lonely bachelor. When I returned
his wife had found him. She told me her story. She
lost her man in New York and had chased him through
the States, and through Europe. He was always giving
her the slip. I think my trembling puritanism rose to
the defence of my innocent soul. Life is of all colours,
but there are some terrible reds and scarlets one doesn’t
see in England. Warsaw to me was a wicked city.
The wonderful beauty of Polish girls I had then no eyes
for.</p>

<p class='c013'>I returned to England and was a local lion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The trip brought me pleasant glory, but it had given
me powerful hopes and longings. I had been in the
Kremlin and in the churches. I had been a vagabond
at the Fair of Nizhni Novgorod. I had seen the peasants
and their faces and eyes and lives. I learned many
things from these peasant faces. I said to myself at
Moscow: “These people are like what English people
were when Edward the Third was king.” Of a face passing
I would say to myself: “There are three or four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>hundred years behind that nose and mouth and eyes and
chin.” The irresistible question came: “Are these
peasants not better off than the English clerk or
labourer?” As a question I left it.</p>

<p class='c013'>England again! I returned, for I had an appointment
there, comfortable though not literary. Life had
good things in store for me there—more reading, new
acquaintances, a new Friend even. I took up Russian
more seriously and commenced a translation of a novel
of Dostoievsky. I was learning to know others of that
Great Society, and one day the Fates brought me to
Zarathustra. I was an unruly candidate for a place in
the society of the “free, very free spirits,” but a true
candidate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Puritanism and intolerance were now to be attacked.
A thawing wind began to blow upon the winter of my
discontent. “Convictions are prisons,” I read. And
surely I was imprisoned behind many prison walls. I
was in the centre of a labyrinth of convictions and
principles. I believed in work and, at the same time,
I believed in myself. Neitzsche reinforced the belief
in myself. I was doing work that was not congenial.
I was in work that imprisoned me and that prevented
development. I was longing for the new. Still in my
heart lived the sentences: “Do the impossible, pay for
the New with all the Old.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I wanted new life, broader horizons, deeper depths,
higher heights. I knew these might be purchased by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>giving up my appointment in London and throwing myself
into Russia. Yes, to go to Russia and live there,
that was my next step. I came to that conclusion one
Sunday in June. In one little moment I made that big
decision. The tiniest seed was sown in Time. The
Fates stood by, the seed lived. To-day that seed
is bearing the finest blossoms. May each chapter
here be a garland of its flowers exhaling their life
perfume.</p>

<p class='c013'>I shaped my plans to the end.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A Yea, a Nay</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A straight line</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A Goal’—saith Zarathustra.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>My Yea was Russia; my Nay, England; the straight
line, the nearest way, my Goal, the new life to be paid
for with all the old.</p>

<p class='c013'>In London I had made a Russian acquaintance, the
son of a deacon of the Orthodox Church, and just before
my departure I received an invitation to spend Christmas
at Lisitchansk, a village some way north of the
Sea of Azov, some miles south of Kharkov. Russia
had seemed dark, enigmatical, terrible, but here at the
last minute arms stretched out of the darkness, welcoming
me, alluring me.</p>

<p class='c013'>On what was Old Year’s Night in England, though
in Russia only the eighteenth of December, I was at
Dover. The lights of the harbour shone on the placid
water. The stars looked down upon my starting, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>same stars that were at that moment looking down
upon my destination also, my stars, the stars that
through all my wanderings have shone down. One
Friend bade me farewell. At Dover, on the ship in the
harbour in the night, we embraced and parted. England
herself grasped my hand and bade me farewell. For
a moment, in the stillness, the sea ceased to exist and
space was gone—Two hands were clasped between the
lands.</p>

<p class='c013'>My life as a wanderer began. I might say my life
as a tramp began, for I never worked again. I became,
as the philosopher says, “full of malice against the
seductions of dependency that lie concealed in houses,
money or positions.” Whereas I had sold myself to
work, I had now bought myself back, I had exchanged
dependence upon man for dependence upon God, and
had given up my respectable West-End home in
“Berkeley Square,” so that I might take up my abode
in the West End of this Universe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps not then, but now I ask: “Could anything
be more amusing than the modern cry of the Right to
Work? The English are an industrious, restless nation.
And the prophets are very censorious of our respectable,
though not respected, class. “It is not enough to be
industrious,” says Thoreau; “so are the ants. The
question is, What are you industrious about?” No one
questions the use of industry of one kind or another.
Dear Carlyle, my guide, philosopher and friend, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>wonder if he, in other realms, has learned the value of
idleness. Perhaps now, after a life-time of Nirvana in
some Eden planet, he has smoothed out his ruffled soul.
Oh, friends, there are depths of calm and happiness to
be found even here, and not autumn stillness but spring
calm, the joyful peace of the dove brooding on the
waters. I have learned to smooth and compose a
rough, tumbled mind until it was like a broad, unsullied
mirror reflecting the beauty of the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two thousand miles from London there are new
silences, pregnant stillness, on the steppes, in the country
places, on the skirts of the old forests. No word of the
hubbub of democracy need come through; not a hoarding
poster flaunts the eye; no burning question of the
hour torments the mind. A man is master of himself
and may see or hear or consider just what he chooses.
That is, if the man be like me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You look up at the sky, as you lie under a bush,
and it keeps descending, descending to you, as though
it wanted to embrace you.... Your soul is warm
and quietly joyful, you desire nothing, you envy no
one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“... And so it seems as though on all the earth
there were only you and God....”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All around is silence: only the birds are singing,
and this silence is so marvellous that it seems as though
the birds were singing in your own breast.” So wrote
Gorky, the tramp. I almost wish he would write the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>story of his vagabondage instead of being so serious
over his revolutionary propaganda.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have shown how I came to be a wanderer. I will
now add to this prologue a word of dedication. The
prose of this book is the story of my travels; the poetry,
when the reader may discern it, is the story of my heart.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c007'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />ROBBED IN THE TRAIN</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>GERMANY is a safe country. One is not
permitted to lose oneself there. I, for
my part, knew not a word of German beyond
<i>nicht hinauslehnen</i>, which means:
don’t put your head out at the window; but I had no
misadventures there. The trains leave punctually,
the carriages are all clean, the porters know their duty.
One contrast has particularly impressed me. In
Russia, in second or even in first-class carriages, washing
accommodation is very poor. Often there is no water,
and there is seldom a stopper to the hand-basin. There
is a murky mirror but no towel, indeed, no further convenience
of any kind. In Germany, on the contrary,
even third-class accommodation is superb. There is
a fresh tablet of soap and a clean towel for each
traveller; there is even a comb and brush, if one cares
to use them after others. But in Russia third-class
accommodation is unspeakably filthy, and I think that if
one mentioned the idea of soap gratis to a Russian
official he would frown as if overhearing revolutionary
propaganda. Surely the Germans have the cleanest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>faces among all nations, and their free wash seems to
say: “For God’s sake, don’t let a little piece of official
soap stand between you and cleanliness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But though Russian accommodation is inferior in this
respect, it has one great excellence: the trains run
smoothly over the lines. One can make the whole
trans-Siberian journey from Warsaw to Shanghai and
be as fit at the end as when one started. The movement
of the train is so pleasantly soothing that one slips
easily into slumber. Indeed, if one wakes in the night
and finds the train stopping in a station, one waits and
longs for the train to move again; minutes seem
eternities. Then one is entitled by one’s ticket to the
whole length of a seat. No one objects if one undresses,
and at least one can always remove collar,
boots and overcoat. But German trains are noisy;
they jerk and rattle and tear through the night. They
compare with Russian trains as a motor omnibus might
with a child’s cradle. One would stand more chance of
sleeping in the Inner Circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>I arrived at Alexandrovo, the frontier town, at ten
o’clock at night, and took train on for Warsaw at 1 a.m.
My luggage was registered through to Kharkov. The
customs officer informed me that it had been forwarded
and would be examined there. This was on the
third day of my journey, and I had had two nights without
sleep. It was with a great deal of gladness that I
settled myself down in my Russian <i>coupé</i> and hoped to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>sleep a few hours. The third bell, the last bell, sounded,
and the train moved slowly out of the station and
ground itself away over the heavy, snow-covered track.
The guards came and punched my ticket; then I lay
back and fell fast asleep. The white train moved over
the white fields, and the light wind blew the thick snow
against the window panes, or wreathed it in the gangways
between the corridors. The train moved very
slowly, and every quarter of an hour or so stopped.
The movement was very weak and gentle, like the
pulsation of an old man’s heart. When it ceased, it
seemed to have paused through utter exhaustion. I
was suddenly awakened by a touch on the shoulder.
I opened my eyes and saw a man bending over me. I
could have sworn he had been picking my pockets. He
smiled unamiably and asked a question in German.
Getting no answer he tried Polish; I replied in Russian.
He wanted to know where I was going to, and whether
I was a German.</p>

<p class='c013'>This man afterwards robbed me. Next time I
woke up my heavy overcoat was gone. I had hung it
on a peg beside me, and when I looked for it it had disappeared.
And the smiling Pole who had been sitting
opposite had also disappeared. New people were in
the compartment. In fact, the moment I woke
there were two men standing beside me and kissing
one another frantically. The train had stopped at a
station. I was dazed. I thought I was, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>at Warsaw already. I was assured Warsaw was
a long way off, and then I discovered the loss of my
coat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chief guard assured me the coat would be recovered.
If I would give him a rouble he would have
the train searched. He took down notes of what I said
and pocketed the money, but the thief got clear away.
The flickering candle that illuminated the carriage was
burning out. It was so dark that one could not be sure
whether anything were lost or not. My astonishment
was great when I looked under the seat and saw a man
lying there—a man with a smell. The guard came in
at that moment and we hauled the stowaway out. I
thought it was the thief for certain. He was brought
out and searched. He was a tatterdemalion, out at
knees and out at elbows, thick with grease and dirt.
His feet were wrapped up with sacking, tied round with
rope, and the rest of his attire was uncured sheepskin.
He hadn’t any ticket and was going to Warsaw. He
offered the guard twopence as a bribe, but the latter
frowned terribly and asked whether I would care to
have him arrested. He whispered to me aside that he
felt quite sure we had caught the thief or an accomplice.
If I would give him two roubles he would make
a declaration at the next station. I should get my coat
in a week at least. But I dissented, for I felt quite
sure such a disreputable-looking character as the moujik
we had hauled out was incapable of stealing a handsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>overcoat. So the guard accepted twopence from the
man in lieu of a ticket, and was fain to disappear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Russian trains are well heated. It is only when one
steps out at a station that one realises how cold it is.
I soon began to realise what the loss of my coat meant.
At Kharkov there were forty degrees of frost. The
further into Russia the colder it became. My only protection
was a light summer overcoat and a plaid rug.
My gloves, together with a voluminous silk muffler, had
been left in the pockets of the coat that was stolen.
When I went out at Kharkov the cold struck in on all
sides, and my moustache and eyebrows froze to solid ice
at once.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calamity followed close upon calamity. My
registered luggage was nowhere to be found. The
customs officer was of opinion that it had been delayed
on the line. If I would leave ten roubles with him he
would look after it and forward it some time after
Christmas.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cup of misery seemed filled to the brim. For I
was deprived of all my clothes but the rough travelling
things I stood up in. I pictured to myself what a
strange, shabby Christmas guest I should appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the 23rd of December, according to the old
calendar; the morrow would be Christmas Eve, and
all shops would be shut. I went out into the town and
made good some of my deficiencies.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had still a hundred-mile journey to make before I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>reached Lisitchansk. The train left at 9 p.m. I telegraphed
to my friend, asking to be met, and then went
off to buy a ticket. The booking-office clerk would not
issue tickets until he could be sure that the train would
be run. The last express from Sevastopol had arrived
ten hours late.</p>

<p class='c013'>I waited until midnight, and then at last a notice
was put out intimating that the train would start. So
I purchased my ticket and took my seat, and at two in
the morning we moved slowly out. My impression of
that train is that everyone, including passengers,
guards and driver, was drunk. It was crowded with
people going home for Christmas. It was so crowded
that there seemed to be no intention on the part of
anyone to sleep, and I could not get a seat to myself.
At length, however, a very friendly, though tipsy,
Little Russian made an arrangement with the occupants
of a ladies’ compartment, and I got an upper
shelf there to lie upon.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I awakened it was broad day and the train
had stopped finally. A lady on a shelf opposite was
reading a novel. No one else seemed to be in the
carriage. I learned from her that we were snowed up.
All the men employed to keep the line clear were dead
drunk. No further progress would be made until after
dinner. There was a forest on the right-hand side,
full of wolves, the girl said. I went along to the men’s
compartment and found that everyone had adjourned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>to a farm-house near by to get dinner. Evidently
thieves were not feared in that part of the country. I
followed the others to the house and had a good hot dish
of cabbage soup. It was a one-room cottage, and was
packed with people. The clamour was deafening. I
think the family must have had an unusually large
supply of vodka, for the number of Christmas healths
drunk was at least treble the number of guests.</p>

<p class='c013'>At about three o’clock the engine-driver, who was
so drunk that he could not stand up, was lifted into the
engine and he set the train going. Scarcely anyone was
in the train, neither people nor guards, and there was a
rush to get on. But only about six were successful;
the rest were all left behind. We, at the farm-house,
had no chance whatever. Somebody said, “The train
is starting,” and there was a stampede. Every vodka
glass was drained, the singing stopped, and the shouting
and the step-dancing, and everyone rushed out into the
snow without, as far as I could see, paying a farthing to
the good woman of the house. But no one stood any
chance, and when I got out at the door the train had
travelled a hundred yards. The snow was a foot deep,
and nothing short of a pair of skis would have enabled
anyone to cross it in the time.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Que faire!</i></p>

<p class='c013'>I pictured to myself the train arriving at Sevastopol
without passengers or guards, and I wondered what
would happen to all the unclaimed wraps and bags, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>how many roubles it would cost to get them out of the
lost property office. I could afford to smile. Most of
my property was already lost. Among the other
passengers there was consternation. They were like
a pack of frightened children, whispering in awe-stricken
whispers. Two men insisted on telling me their fears—fears
of missing their Christmas, fears of exhausting
the vodka supply, fears of wolves, fears of freezing,
and a fat man, who had fallen in the snow, kept punctuating
their remarks with:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take me! Lord save us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was nothing to be gained by remaining where
we were, so I set out along the railway lines with six
others who could walk. The next station proved to be
about four miles distant, and after three quarters of an
hour we came in sight of it. And in sight of the train!
We had walked very seriously and solemnly, like convicts
marching to the mines. I, for my part, felt like
freezing to death. But at the sight of the train we all
burst into exclamation. The Russians gesticulated
and waved their handkerchiefs. Then suddenly we
thought it might start out before we reached it. The
Russians began to run in that peculiar way all
foreigners run—as if someone were after them. We
arrived in time, feeling pleasantly warm.</p>

<p class='c013'>I thought when the engine-driver had been remonstrated
with he would have backed the train to the
wayside stopping-place. But no, he said there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>time, and in ten minutes he started us off again. I have
never heard how they fared, these unfortunates who
were left behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Late in the evening I arrived at Lisitchansk, and
Nicholas, my London acquaintance, was actually there
waiting for me. He had brought a large fur cloak and
rugs. A little pony-sledge was at hand. We fitted
ourselves in tightly and gave the word to the driver,
who whisked us off through the keen air.</p>

<p class='c013'>In twenty minutes we had climbed up the steep
slope to the village and threaded our way through the
broad streets to the cottage of my friend.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c018'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c015'>NICHOLAS was twenty-one years of age and
was the eldest child. His father, who
was the village deacon, was in his prime.
Six feet high, broad-shouldered, he was a
proper figure of a man. Thick black hair hung down
his back. His high-domed forehead and well-formed
aquiline nose reminded one of Tennyson. His wife
was a short, dear woman, who moved about in little
steps—the sort of woman that never wears out, tender
and gentle, but, at the same time, strong-bodied and
hardy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two of them welcomed me to their home, and I
felt thrilled with gratitude. Only he who has been out
in the wilds, in distress, in strange parts, among alien
people, can know the full joy of a return to home.
After long travail, after isolation and privation, one’s
heart is very sensitive to loving, human hands. It was
very sweet for me to realise that in the terrible cold, in
the wild night, there was a sheltering roof for me, a
little sanctuary where accident and misfortune could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>no further pursue me, a home where a new father and
mother awaited me.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cottage was a very simple one. It was built
of pine trunks placed one across another, reticulated at
the comers in the style that children build with firewood.
It contained three rooms. The partitions
were of bright new wood and unadorned. We sat on
straight-back wooden chairs at a wooden table, on
which no cloth was spread. The sacred picture, the
symbol of God in the home, looked down from a cleft
in the pine wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>The family had lately been at prayers, for Christmas
Day begins at six o’clock on the 24th of December.
Before us, on the table, stood the allegorical dish of dry
porridge, eaten in memory of the hay and straw that
lay in the manger in which the Child Jesus was laid.
Nicholas’s little sister, Zhenia, was helping Masha, the
servant, to bring in plates and spoons. A huge bowl,
full of boiled honey and stewed fruit, was set in the
middle of the table, and then mother and father and son
and daughter bowed to the sacred picture and crossed
themselves, and sat down to the meal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inhabitants of Lisitchansk are Little Russians,
and all Little Russians sit down to honey and porridge
on Christmas Eve. They call the custom <i>koutia</i>, and
they cherish it as something distinguishing them from
Great Russians or White Russians. The deacon explained
its significance to me. What he said sounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>rather naïve in my ears. The Communion is a death
feast; Koutia is in memory of His birth. “It is just
a special Communion service,” said he, “and it is held
only once a year.” He explained how each dish represented
the manger: First we put porridge in the dish,
which was like putting straw in the manger. The
mother helped each of us to porridge; she stood for
Mary, who would, of course, see that there was plenty
of straw, so that it might be soft and warm. Then we
each helped ourselves to honey and fruit and that
symbolised The Babe. We made a place in the porridge
and then poured the honey and fruit in. The fruit
stood for the body; the honey stood for the spirit or
the blood. “Blood means spirit, when one is speaking
of Christ,” said the deacon, whom I perceived to be
somewhat of a mystic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Outside the cottage the wind roared and the snow
sifted against the window panes. We were all present
at the birth of Christ, and had been transported as if by
magic to Bethlehem of Christmas night over nineteen
centuries ago.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The brightness of the cottage faded into the half light
of a stable, where a child lay in a manger among the
horses and the oxen. Joseph and Mary were near and
I had just arrived, having followed a particular bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>star that for two thousand miles had led me here. Time
itself had given birth to a child. My own new tender
life lay in a cradle before me.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Koutia</i> remained on the table and guests came and
partook of the meal. They might have been the Wise
Men, the Kings with gifts of gold, frankincense and
myrrh. Nicholas told me that the guests would return
home by a different way from that by which they came—in
order to escape Herod. Then the deacon took up
a guitar and played carols, typifying, whether he intended
it or not, the music of the angel hosts.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think we spent too little of this night in bed.
Much was to happen yet. Nicholas proposed a walk.
We bowed to the sacred picture and took our leave.
The deacon also had to go out. He curled up his long
hair and put it under a high fur hat, and then wrapped
himself in a purple cloak.</p>

<p class='c013'>We stepped out along a narrow trench between two
banks of snow, waist-high. There were no lights in the
village. The snow fell no longer, but a strong wind
blew the drift top in our faces. A heaven, distant and
black, but radiant with stars, looked down upon us,
and upon the white roofs of the village houses and upon
the crosses and domes of the church. All was utterly
silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the church the deacon left us, and we went on
beyond the village. There is an exposed path that
leads up to the crest of the ridge, above the River
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Donetz. The wind had swept every loose particle of
snow away, so that it was smooth as glass and hard as
steel, like a well-used toboggan track. The wind behind
us fairly took us up by itself, without any effort
on our part, and when we reached the summit it began
to blow us down on the other side. It blew us off our
feet so that we both went rolling down the steep slope
to the river, and we did not gain a foothold till we
plunged into a huge bank of snow formed by a rock
beside the river bed. It was a very amusing experience
and we sat down in the snow and laughed.
The wind blew as if it considered our mirth ill-timed.
We gathered our cloaks about us and cowered from it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a stiff walk home and the wind was appalling.
The sound of music came to us as we came round a bend
in sight of the village, and presently we saw a group of
carol singers carrying what appeared to be a lantern.
When we came nearer we found them to be a group of
boys carrying a pasteboard star. The centre of the
star was clear and a candle was fixed so that the light
shone through; I thought at first it was a turnip
lantern. When we looked closer we found that there
was a picture of Christ in the centre, so that the light
shone through the face. The chief boy carried the star
and the next to him twirled the points. It was an
interesting point that they made no collection; though,
I am told, they all got a few coppers on the morrow.
It was a very charming representation of the Star of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Bethlehem. It made its whole journey whilst we were
getting home, for we saw it finally enter the church,
which, it may be supposed, they considered the most
fitting place for the star to rest. They were all boys,
and on an English Christmas Eve they would doubtless
have been asleep, dreaming of Father Christmas and
the car of toys drawn by the reindeer. And that reminds
me—Father Christmas knows Russia also. We
saw stockings hung outside several cottage doors. It
apparently is the custom to hang them outside, so
Santa Claus has not to solve the problem of coming
down the chimney.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every cottage window had a light and, looking
through, we saw abundance of Christmas fare spread
upon the tables. At some there were already guests
eating and drinking. The three days’ feast had commenced.
Nicholas and I went indoors and made a
meal and went to bed.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>II</h3>

<p class='c017'>The succeeding week was an orgy of eating and
drinking. I had already spent one Christmas in England
and had eaten not less than a big man’s share of
turkey and plum-pudding, but I was destined to out-do
in Russia every table feat that our homely English
board had witnessed. On Christmas Day alone I ate
and drank, for courtesy, at eight different houses.
Nicholas accomplished prodigious feats, and the worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>deacon was as much beyond Nicholas as the latter was
beyond me. Let me describe the spread. There were,
of course, chicken, turkey and vodka; there was sucking-pig,
roasted with little slices of lemon. There were
joints of venison and of beef, roast goose, wild duck,
fried sturgeon and carp, fat and sweet, but full of bones;
caviare, tinned herrings, mushrooms, melons, infusion
of fruit and Caucasian wines. The steaming samovar
was always on the sideboard, and likewise tumblers of
tea, sweetened with jam or sharpened by lemon slices.
There were huge loaves of home-baked bread, but no
cakes or biscuits, and no puddings. At peasants’ houses
the fare was commoner, but not less abundant, than at
the squires’, and it was very difficult to escape from
either without making a meal equal to an English lunch.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Russians are a hospitable nation and, above all
things, like to keep open house. On the great feast
days everyone is <i>at home</i>—and everyone is also out
visiting. That is, the women stay at home and superintend
the hospitalities and the men go the rounds.
At Moscow it is a full-dress function; one drives about
the city all day. At Lisitchansk it is less polite and
more hearty than in the old capital and one makes no
distinction of persons. Nicholas and I went out to the
postman, and together with the postman we went to a
poor peasant’s dwelling, a one-room cottage where a
man and his wife and ten children lived and slept.
There was a glorious fire and a pot of soup hanging from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>a hook over it. Very poor people they were, and the
children were thin and wretched, but friends had given
them extra coal and food and vodka, and it was as gaily
Christmas there as anywhere else. We took a snack
of their food and detached the man from his family and
went away to the oilman’s home. We were four now,
and it seemed as if we were going to increase like a ball
of snow, but we dropped the postman with the oilman.
Just at the door, as we left, we met the deacon, who
arranged to meet us at the soap factory in the afternoon,
and whilst we were talking the farmer of the vodka
monopoly came up and insisted on all of us coming to
his house at night. He forcibly reminded me of my
train adventure, for he was the first very drunk man I
had seen in Lisitchansk. From the moment he appeared
on the scene to his actual parting he kept up a
grotesque step-dance, the <i>Kamarinsky Moujik</i>, the
deacon said. It seemed to consist chiefly in doing the
<i>splitz</i>. After leaving him we went home and were just
in time to meet the village police, who had come for
Christmas drinks. I think they were all at the fifteenth
glass of vodka. It was a matter of speculation to me
how far they would get before they finally collapsed.
I should think the remoter districts of the village were
unvisited by these worthies. One of them had been in
Siberia. “Ah, brother, you get vodka out there.”
Klick, he smacked his lips. “There was an Englishman
took a glass of Siberian vodka and for two days he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>drunk. On the third day he drank a glass of water and
that made him drunk again.” Klick, he smacked his
lips again. “That’s what.” And he blinked his eyes
at me with peculiar assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the police had tottered out the village
musicians came in playing carols. The leader played
the violin; he was the choir-master, an elderly man
with flashing eyes and long black hair. Behind him
were four young men with guitars or balalaikas. Then
came a group of boys, perhaps the same as those who
had followed the Star of Bethlehem the night before.
They played some hymns and then received coppers
all round. The elders drank a glass of vodka each, and
then their leader, by way of thanks, gave the Ukrainsky
National Dance on the violin, and stamped his feet and
danced to the music. Nearly everyone in the room
was moving legs or body to the music, and when the
musicians made a move to go the scene was so lively
that one might have thought the fairy fiddler had been
present. The music ceased and the choir hurried away.
They had to visit every house in the village, and so time
was precious to them; they certainly couldn’t linger
in the deacon’s house. I heard afterwards there was
one family they didn’t visit; these were Baptists, and
had celebrated their Christmas a fortnight earlier with
the rest of Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'>We met the deacon at the soap factory and there
made a great feast off sucking-pig. A Little-Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>girl induced me to drink half a glass of vodka on condition
that she drank the other half. I insisted that
her half should be the first, and then I did not resist the
bribe. But I don’t think her lips allayed the fire. She
had the best of the bargain, and the company collapsed
with laughter at my expense.</p>

<p class='c013'>A number of us left the factory to go to the Squire’s,
and as we tramped through the snow there was a lively
discussion as to the grandeur of the spread and the
merits of sucking-pig. The Chief of Police was with us,
and he was of opinion that Pavel Ivanovitch was getting
too deep in debt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What of that,” said a military officer, “everyone
is in debt. ‘Not in debt, not decent.’ Don’t you know
the proverb?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How fond you seem to be of getting together and
eating and singing and dancing,” said I. “In England
all the people are huddled up close to one another and yet
one seldom takes tea with the next-door neighbour even.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The deacon replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are all like the people of Moscow or Kiev or
St Petersburg, I expect. You have forgotten that you
are brothers. Money has come between you and money
has made you work. You are all gathered together,
not out of love, but out of hate. In England <i>gregariousness</i>,
in Russia <i>conviviality</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, we live together,” said the Chief of Police;
“you die together.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“You have your pogroms,” I retorted, and everyone
looked very grave, for they were all staunch supporters
of the Tsar.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The vine is better for the cutting,” said the
deacon, softly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But surely you do not approve of shedding blood,
you do not think it Christian to fight your enemies?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We do not strike them. They are cursed by God,
and when they are struck it is by Him. But it is not
a matter for argument. You have come to see Russia,
you look about, and you will find happiness wherever
you go. We are all happy, even the Jews, who are only
here to make money out of us. Then, if we are happy
you must not object to our Government.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But are you really happy? In nine out of every
ten provinces you will have famine before the winter is
over, and yet you are all wasting your stores by Christmas
luxuriance. All these poor people who are gorging
themselves to-day will be pinched with hunger to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He who taketh thought for the morrow is a Jew,”
said the officer, and so ended the conversation by flooding
it with laughter. Everyone laughed, and I think
everyone thought we had been getting too serious.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Squire was the occupant of a grand old house
with many spacious rooms and walls a yard thick. His
dining-table, about twenty feet long, was heaped up
with cold meats and bottles of wine. We were fortunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>enough to escape with a plate of turkey and a glass
of port each.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we came home in the dusk we saw a lover and his
lass who had just plighted their troth. The deacon
insisted on their coming with us. “How was it done?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, she says ‘What is your name?’; he replies,
‘Foma’; she rejoins, ‘Foma is my husband’s name.’
They are very fond of one another and arranged it of
course. It is a custom to plight troth on Christmas
Day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A few days later I was at the girl’s house and part of
the betrothal ritual was concluded. There were about
fourteen of us in one room awaiting the ceremony.
Presently a knock came at the door, and the starosta,
the old man of the village, entered, and with him the
bridegroom. They carried loaves of bread in their
hands. The starosta commenced a recitation in a sing-song
voice. It ran something like this:</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are German people, come from Turkey. We
are hunters, good fellows. There was a time once in
our country when we saw strange foot-prints in the
snow, and my friend the prince here saw them, and we
thought they might be a fox’s or a marten’s foot-prints,
or it might be those of a beautiful girl. We
hunters, we good fellows, are determined not to rest
till we have found the animal. We have been in all
cities from Germany to Turkey, and have sought for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>this fox, this marten or this princess, and at last we have
seen the same strange foot-prints in the snow again,
here by your court. And we have come in. Come,
let us take her, the beautiful princess, for we see her
in front of us—or can it be you would keep her till she
grows a little older?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the father made a speech in the same style,
asking the name and lineage of the proud prince who
sued for his daughter’s hand. Then, after considerable
hesitation, both parties came to agreement, and the
starosta leading the young man forward, and the
father bringing the girl to him, the hands of the loving
pair were joined and blessing was given. The rest of
the evening was given over to carouse.</p>

<p class='c013'>But to return to Christmas Day. We spent the night
at the house of the farmer of the vodka monopoly.
When we met the host he was dancing, and when we
said good-night he was still dancing, and he had been
dancing all the time. Beyond food there was no real
entertainment. A young man played the guitar for
four or five hours, and played the same tune the whole
time. We had two dinners and two teas. At the
second dinner the fifth course was roast sturgeon. I
protested that I couldn’t eat any more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you think you could make all the other
things squeeze up just a little and make room?” said
the hostess.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the Chief of Police,” said the deacon.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“What is?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, the sturgeon! Don’t you know the story
of Gogol? The church was packed full of people, so
that not a single person more could find room. Then
the Chief of Police came and couldn’t get in. But the
priest called out to the people to make room, and then
everyone moved up just a little bit closer. So they
managed to squeeze the Chief of Police in. Now this
sturgeon is the Chief of Police, and you must make the
other things move up.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />MUMMERS AT A COUNTRY HOUSE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>ON St Stephen’s Day we drove in sledges to
a country house. I feasted my eyes on a
wonderful sight—high trees standing
between the white ground and the great
sun, and casting strange shadows on the whitest snow,
and between the shadows a thousand living sparkles
literally shot flames from the glistening snow. I had
never seen anything like it before; it was very beautiful.
We left the forest and passed over a vast plain of
tumbled snow. There was snow everywhere as far as
the eye could see. The sky above was deep glowing blue;
the horizon lines a nascent grey darkness. One looked
out upon an enchanted ocean of snow; the wind had
wreathed it fantastically in crested waves, or left it
gently dimpled like the sands of the seashore. Wave
behind wave glistened and sparkled to the horizon,
and a gentle breeze raised a snow spray from a thousand
crests. The snow scud fled from wave to wave. Yes,
it was very beautiful and new, and the world seemed
very broad and full of peace. I felt it a privilege to
exist in the presence of such beauty. It was my nameday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and it seemed as if there were a special significance
in all the beauty which lay about me. Pure
flame colours were about me as the glistening white
robe of a candidate, to whom new mysteries are to be
revealed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road was hard-beaten snow, a series of frozen
cart ruts. The horses scampered ahead and the sledges
shot after them. The sledge slipped over the snow like
a boat over the reeds of a river. The red-faced driver
sat immobile in his seat. We lay back in the sledges
and took advantage of every inch of fur and rug. The
runners were very low, and we could have touched the
snow as we passed. Sometimes we rushed into a drift,
and the snow would rise in a splash over us. And
wasn’t it cold! My feet became like ice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our new host was a Count Yamschin, owner of a
large estate in the Government of Ekaterinoslav. We
arrived at his house in the afternoon, and I heard the
deacon give orders to the sledge-drivers to return for
us at midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The house was a large one, the rooms spacious.
Like Russian houses in general, it was simply and
meagrely furnished. But for the people in them the
rooms would have seemed empty. There were no
carpets on the floor; only here and there a soft Persian
rug. The firelight from the logs blazing on the broad
hearth was the only illumination until late in the twilight.
One watched the shadows about the high ceiling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and in the recesses; animated faces moved into the
bright gleam of light or passed into the shade. In a
corner darker than the others stood the precious Ikons,
the sacred pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were ten or fifteen people in the room, and we
chatted in groups for half an hour. The principal
topic of conversation was about a mystery play which
was going to be performed in the evening. It was
called the <i>Life of Man</i>, and everyone had evidently
heard much about it before the performance. “You
will see,” said the deacon, “it is an Ikon play. The
Ikon speaks.” Presently the eldest son came striding
in in jack-boots and besought us to go into the concert-hall.
This was apparently part of a separate building,
and we had all to wrap ourselves up and step into our
goloshes, so as to trip through the shrubbery with no
discomfort. It was a large hall and would have easily
held all the people of the village. There was a stage
curtained off, and in the body of the hall a grand piano.
We held an impromptu concert, made up for the most
part of songs and recitations in the Little Russian
language. Little Russian is to Russian what broad
Scotch is to English. I met a student who knew many
long speeches from Shakespeare by heart, but Shakespeare
in Russian translation. Shakespeare is a compulsory
subject in most Russian colleges, and students
have, on the whole, as good a knowledge of it as English
people have. The young man professed to be extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>enthusiastic over the <i>Life of Man</i>, which was
an expansion of Shakespeare’s thought:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All the world’s a stage,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And all the men and women merely players.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Do you believe in God?” asked the student,
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” I said. “I use the word God and mean
something by it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are old-fashioned.” He laughed. “We
don’t believe in God, we students; we are all atheists.
You’re coming to Moscow, you’ll see. We don’t believe
in anything except Man. We have given too much
time to God already; it’s high time we turned our
attention to Man. Is it possible you have not yet
heard that God is dead? Why, where have you been?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see you have been reading Nietzsche,” I remarked
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked at me with annoyance. “The English
also read Nietzsche?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I assented.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he went on, “we’ve got God on the stage,
you’ll see. We don’t call him God, but it’s God all the
same. We call him the old man in grey. We had to
do that so as to smuggle him past the censor. The
censor, you know, has just stopped Oscar Wilde’s
<i>Salome</i>, not because it’s indecent, but because it deals
with a biblical subject. I think we’ve got a better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>censor than yours, however; he has licensed <i>Ghosts</i>
and <i>Mrs Warren’s Profession</i>, and it’s perfectly easy to
manage him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did the deacon mean when he said the Ikon
speaks?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, that is his way of looking at it. The huge
figure in grey, which you will see, is really meant for
God. God gives the play for the benefit of mankind.
God speaks the opening words. He shows the life of
one man and says it is a typical life, and <i>that</i> is man’s
life upon this earth, <i>that</i> and neither more nor less.
During all the five acts God stands in a dark corner like
an Ikon; he is visible to the audience as a God, but the
actors on the stage behave, for the most part, as if it
were only a sacred picture. God holds a candle, and
as the play gets older the candle gradually burns lower
and lower until, when Man dies, it finally expires. To
Man on the stage this candle is only visible as the little
lamp burning before the Ikon. He makes plans, he
succeeds, he fails, he prays or curses, he is trivial or
serious, and all the while the candle representing his
life burns lower and nothing can stop the wasting of
the wax.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this point Miss Yamschin came and called us all
back to dinner. So we all trooped back to the room
where the log fire gleamed. Three or four paraffin lamps
were now lit, and a pleasant light was diffused through
their green shades. An uncle of Nicholas’s had arrived,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>a station-master from a village ten versts away on a by-line.
He waited impatiently while the deacon explained
who I was, and then transfixed me with this
question:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who lost the Japanese War—the Russian Government
or the people?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Government, of course,” I replied. Whereupon
he unexpectedly flung his arms round my neck
and kissed me on both cheeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I had had charge of the war, whew!” he
whistled. “D’you see the palm of my hand there;
now, there’s the Japanese Army.” Puff, he puffed out
his cheeks with air and blew the Japanese Army off his
palm and off the face of the earth. He winked at me
with assurance. “That’s what I’d do.” He tapped
his head and his chest and said knowingly: “Do you
see these, ah-ha, pure Russian, they are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak to me in English,” he went on. “I learned
English at school, but I’ve forgotten—‘Not a drum
was heard, not a funeral note’—eh? D’ye know
that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>When we got to table the uncle made a long
speech, wishing prosperity and happiness to the young
Englishman who had come out to Russia to make his
fortune. England was the greatest country in the
world, next to Russia. If the English soldiers would
give up rum and take to vodka they would be the
greatest soldiers in the world. When we had all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>drunk that toast he proposed another, hoping I might
find a beautiful Russian girl to love. The count was
what we should call a good sort in England. He let
everyone do exactly as he pleased, except in the matter
of wine, to which no refusals were accepted. It was
an uproarious dinner-table; not only the young men,
but the girls joined in the conviviality. I was lionised.
They drank eleven healths to me all round; it was a
matter of wonder what the next plea would be, but the
uncle’s brain was very fertile. I counted that in all I
drank twenty-six glasses of wine that day, and yet
when I had been in England I was not quite sure
whether I was a teetotaller or not. I was finally persuaded
to make a speech in Russian, in which my
Russian gave way, and I was forced to conclude in
English. I managed to propose the host’s health, and
that was the best thing I could have done. Approbation
was uproarious.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, at last, the dinner was over, we filed into the
concert-hall to see the <i>Life of Man</i> performed. My
student companion was evidently one of the actors,
since I looked to resume our conversation, but he was
nowhere to be found. The drama was one of Leonid
Andrief’s, a new Russian author, whose works have
been making him a great name in Russia during the
last five years. <i>The Life of Man</i> was produced in the
Theatre of Art, Moscow, said to be the greatest theatre
in the world. It has made a great impression in Russia;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>I have come across it everywhere in my wanderings,
even in the most unlikely places. Its words and its
characters have become so familiar to the public that one
scarcely opens a paper without finding references to it.
It has been the inspiration of thousands of cartoonists.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was true, as the student had said, God, as it were,
gave the play. The words of the prologue were among
the most impressive I have ever heard, and spoken as
they were in dreadful sepulchral tones by a figure who,
at least, stood for God, they are fixed indelibly in my
memory. My programme said, “<i>Prologue: Someone
in the greyness speaks of the life of a Man</i>.” As the Prologue
is a summary of the play, I shall give it. Picture
a perfectly dark stage, and in the darkness a figure
darker than the darkness itself, enigmatical, immense.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Behold and listen</i>,” it said, “<i>ye people, come
hither for amusement and laughter. There passes before
you the life of a Man—darkness in the beginning, darkness
at the end of it. Hitherto not existent, buried in the
boundless time, unthought of, unfelt, known by none; he
secretly oversteps the bounds of nonentity, and with a cry
announces the beginning of his little life. In the night of
nothingness, a lamp casts a gleam, lit by an unseen hand—it
is the life of Man. Look upon the flame of it—the
life of a Man.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>When he is born he takes the form and name of man
and in all things becomes like other people already living
upon the earth. And the cruel destiny of these becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>his destiny, and his cruel destiny the destiny of all people.
Irresistibly yoked to time he unfailingly approaches all
the steps of Man’s life, from the lower to the higher, from
the higher to the lower. By sight limited, he will never
foresee the next steps for which he raises his tender feet;
by knowledge limited, he will never know what the coming
day will bring him, the coming hour—minute. And in
his blind ignorance, languishing through foreboding,
agitated by hopes, he submissively completes the circle of
an iron decree.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Behold him—a happy young man. Look how
brightly the candle burns! The icy wind of the limitless
sky cannot disturb, or in the slightest deflect the movement
of the flame. Radiantly and brightly burns the candle.
But the wax diminishes with the burning. The wax
diminishes.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Behold him—a happy husband and father. But,
look how dully and strangely the candle-light glimmers,
as if its yellowed flame were withering, trembling from the
cold and hiding itself. And the wax is wasting, following
the burning. The wax is wasting.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Behold him—an old man, sickly and weak. Already
the steps of life are ending, and a black chasm is in the
place of them—but, spite of that, his trembling feet are
drawn forwards. Bending towards the earth, the flame,
now blue, droops powerlessly, trembles and falls, trembles
and falls—and slowly expires.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>So Man will die. Coming out of the night he will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>return to the night and vanish without traces into the
boundless time, unthought of, unfelt, known by none. And
I, then, named by all He, remain the true fellow-traveller
of Man in all the days of his life, in all his ways. Unseen
by Man and near him, I shall be unfailingly beside
him when he wakes and when he sleeps, when he prays or
when he curses. In the hours of pleasure when he breathes
freely and bravely, in the hours of despondency and grief,
when the languor of death darkens his soul and the blood
grows cold about his heart, in the hours of victory and of
defeat, in the hours of the great struggle with the inevitable,
I shall be with him. I shall be with him.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>And you come hither for amusement, you, the devoted
of death, behold and listen. With this far-off and
phantasmal figure there unfolds itself to your gaze, with
its sorrows and its joys, the quickly passing life of Man.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>The voice from the grey figure ceased, and in the
dark a curtain came down over the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>The play was as foreshadowed. In the first act a
Man is born, in the second he is a struggling young man,
in the third he is a successful man, in the fourth he is in
decline, and in the fifth he dies. The figure in grey
appears at the birth of Man, and is visible to the
audience throughout the five acts. He holds a burning
candle, which is radiantly bright in Act iii., but which
gutters out at the end of Act v. Fates, old women,
nornas, are in attendance at the birth, and they are
again in attendance at death.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The story is delicately told and affecting. Man is
young and happy and the obstacles in his life are only
means of happiness; he succeeds and all the world does
homage to him; he passes the prime of life and new
obstacles appear, and these serve only to bring him unhappiness;
he is brought low and he dies.</p>

<p class='c013'>The actor who played Man’s part was a robust,
handsome man with flashing eyes and long hair. Whilst
he played the young Man he was careless, brave, free,
and when he became old he was dignified, proud and
obstinate. His destiny, it seemed to me, was comprised
between a challenge and a curse. In his despair
in Act ii., when life seemed a feast to which he was not
bidden, he was stung to anger and defiance against
Fate. He turned to where the ikon stood and flung
a challenge at the Unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>—Hi you! you there! what d’you call yourself?
Fate, devil or life, there’s my glove; I’ll fight you!
Wretched, poor-spirited folk curse themselves before your
enigmatical power: thy stone face moves them to terror,
in thy silence they hear the beginning of calamities and
their own terrible ruin. But I am brave and strong and
I challenge you to battle. With bright swords, with sounding
shields, we will fall at one another’s heads with blows
at which the earth will tremble. Hi! Come out and
fight.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>To thy ominous slow movement I shall oppose my
living, vigilant strength; to thy gloom my gay sounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>laugh! Hi! Take that blow, ward it off if you can!
Your brow is stone, your reason lost. I throw into it the
red-hot shot of my bright sense; you have a heart of stone
that has lost all pity, give way! I shall pour into it the
burning poison of my rebellious cries! By the black cloud
of thy fierce anger the sun is obscured; we shall light up the
gloom with dreams! Hi! Take that!</i></p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Conquering, I will sing songs which all the world will
cheer; silently falling under thy blow, my only thought
shall be of rising again to battle! There is a weak place
in my armour, I know it. But, covered with wounds, the
ruby blood flowing, I shall yet gather strength to cry—and
even then, thou evil enemy of Man, I shall overcome Thee.
And, dying on the field of battle, as the brave die, with one
loud amen I shall annul thy blind pleasure! I have conquered,
I have conquered my wicked enemy; not even in
my last breath do I acknowledge his power. Hi, there!
Hi! Come out and fight! With bright swords, with
sounding shields, we shall fall at one another with blows
at which the earth will tremble! Hi! Come out and
fight!</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>The deacon, the count, his daughters, the tenants
and guests all looked on with breathless interest. We
of the audience knew that which Man on the stage knew
not. We knew that even whilst he was raging against
Fate his fortune was being achieved and his success
assured by two men in a motor-car who were driving
about the town, unable to find Man’s wretched dwelling.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Success came and it vanished. “Vanity of
vanities,” saith the preacher; so I thought, but Man
cursed. He pointed with outstretched arm as if in
delirium at the stone face of the ikon and shrieked:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>I curse Thee and all Thou gavest me. I curse the
day on which I was born and the day when I shall die. I
curse all my life, its pleasures and pains, I curse myself!
I curse my eyes, my hearing, my tongue, I curse my heart,
my head—and everything I throw again into Thy stern
face, senseless Fate. Cursed, cursed for ever! And with
the curse I overcome Thee. What remains that Thou
canst do with me? Hurl me to the ground, hurl, I shall
laugh and shout ‘I curse Thee!’ With the pincers of Death
stop my mouth; with my last sense I shall cry into Thy
ass’s ears, ‘I curse Thee, I curse Thee.’ Take my dead
body, nibble it, like a dog, carry it away into the darkness—I
am not in it, I am vanished away, but vanished, repeating,
‘I curse Thee, I curse Thee.’ Through the head of the
woman thou hast insulted, through the body of the child
thou hast killed—I send to Thee the Curse of Man.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>The dreadful grey figure stood unmoved, silent as
the Sphinx. Only the flame of the candle in its hand
wavered as if the wind blew it. All of us in the audience
shuddered, and the uncle who had become very solemn
suddenly began to sob.</p>

<p class='c013'>Act v. was a dance of drunkards and fates in a
cellar tavern, dark, dirty, fearful. The dreadful, implacable
figure in grey stood far in the darkest corner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and near him, on a bench, sat Man breathing out his
last. The uncle astonished me, and for the moment
almost terrified me by crying out in English:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Out, out, brief candle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Truly, it is strange what quantities of English
literature one finds in even remote places in Russia.</p>

<p class='c013'>But to return, Man died, and none too soon, and the
candle went out. There was no cheering of the actors,
though they were warmly congratulated by the count
later on. We all left the little theatre and went back
to supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>At midnight the sledges came. The uncle insisted
on our going home with him. So we went to his railway
station. Thus ended our night with the mummers at
Count Yamschin’s country house.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />AT UNCLE’S</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_27_0_7 c015'>UNCLE was station-master of a little place
called Rubezhniya, a village of ten families.
Rubezhniya is on the edge of a great forest,
though, I think, that in Russia they call
it a little wood. It extends a few hundred miles, but
then there is a forest in Russia where a squirrel might
travel straight on eastward four thousand miles, going
from branch to branch and never touching earth once.
Rubezhniya is also on the black land, and its peasants
have money in the autumn, though, it may be remarked,
there is never any left by the time winter approaches.
Surplus money, unfortunately, finds its way quickly
to the exchequer of an unthrifty Government and to the
pockets of the farmer of the vodka monopoly.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are no savings banks in Russia and no wives’
stockings. Ivan Ivanovitch lives hand to mouth;
what he earns he spends, and when he earns nothing he
gets food from the man next door, or rather next field—for,
except in towns, there is no next door, and in the
villages there is seldom anything so regular as a road.
Rubezhniya was supposed to be suffering from famine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and the whole district to be in want of relief; I was
therefore interested to see whether Christmas fare was
less plentiful there than in Lisitchansk.</p>

<p class='c013'>Uncle locked us in the first-class waiting-room and
bade us undress and be comfortable as if at home.
The mother and Zhenia he took to his own small lodging.
Once in later days, when I begged hospitality of a
“pope,” he put me in the church, and on another occasion,
when I went to see a police-officer, he asked me if I
would mind sleeping in a cell as he was full up at home.
In some respects Russians are Spartans.</p>

<p class='c013'>We did undress <i>a little</i> and turned out the lamp.
The room was dark save for the little light that burned
before the Ikon, and there was silence. We composed
ourselves to sleep, but after about half an hour came the
heavy rumble of a train. We heard steps on the platform,
the soft crunching sound of someone walking
through crisp snow. Two bells sounded. “The train
waits five minutes here,” whispered the deacon,
gruffly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly a key turned in our door and a hoarse
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take it, where’s the light? I’ve brought
a little friend.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Uncle again. I am sure we all cursed a little
inwardly. But he found his way to the lamp and lit it.
The first thing I noticed was a red parcel on the table.
The parcel turned out to be a baby.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“A little friend I’ve brought,” said Uncle, apologetically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’d ye find it?” asked Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a baby in a sack of red quilted flannel. Uncle
picked it up by the flap of the sack and let it dangle
from his thumb and forefinger in a way to cause a
mother’s heart to tremble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mine,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A girl or a boy?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His name is Tarass, Tarass Bulba, eh?” He
brought the baby to me and sat down on my legs, for
I had not got up from the park seat on which I was
resting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is his mother?” I asked. He put his finger
to his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Asleep; say nothing. My little cossack, <i>there’s</i>
an arm for you,” said he, taking a chubby little limb
from its cosy resting-place, whereupon he proceeded
to undress the child for our edification. But just as he
was concluding that delicate operation a man in a goat-skin
hat and jacket burst into the waiting-room, and a
couple of porters and three third-class passengers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Outside, cut-throats,” said Uncle, pulling out a
pistol from his belt. The porters and the passengers
fled. But the man in the goat-skin jacket held up his
arms as if Uncle had cried “Hands up!” and from the
moment he burst in he had kept saying “Water!” as if
he was demented or the train was on fire.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Water, water, water!” Uncle put up his pistol
in his belt again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“More softly,” he whispered. “You want water?
You’ll get no water here; vodka plenty, but water none.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I came to the conclusion it must be another comic
engine-driver. He protested by Mary in heaven that
they could not go on without water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Won’t vodka do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The engine-driver smiled evasively as much as to
say, “You are pleased to be funny, but this is a serious
matter.” Then the baby began to scream.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take it,” said Uncle. “Clear out. There
<i>is</i> no water I tell you. Wait for a luggage train to push
you to the next station or go to the devil.” At this
point a passenger came in, an aged moujik with long
white hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“God bless all here,” said the moujik.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What <i>is</i> the matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The devil is in our midst!” He crossed himself
and bowed to the Ikon. “Lord have mercy upon us,
for an unclean spirit has come out of the forest!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Colour of his eyes?” asked Nicholas, maliciously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Red, like fire, your Excellency. An unclean spirit
has come out of the forest and entered into the body of
Pavel Fedoritch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He means a man in the train has gone mad,” said
Nicholas. “That comes of running your trains so
fearfully fast and using up all your water.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The engine-driver protested mildly and then stared
at the baby, who was yelling as if Satan had entered into
it as well as into Pavel Fedoritch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord God, preserve us,” said the engine-driver,
and crossed himself feverishly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A man has gone mad,” said Uncle. “Very well,
take him to the police station and ask them to cut his
head off; and now <i>outside</i> all those who haven’t got
first-class tickets!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He rose to push them all out but suddenly gave way
to one mightier than he. A burly woman in a red
petticoat pushed through the little crowd assembled
at the doorway, and levelled abuse to right and to left
till she got right in and snatched up the baby. It was
Auntie. It was Uncle’s wife, and Uncle subsided and
Auntie scolded them all for disturbing our rest and
cleared the room. Then she sat on the table and quieted
the child and told us what a good-for-nothing her
husband was. Poor Uncle! He sat meekly by and
listened. He evidently felt very sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she left us and the train went out, without
water and without discharging the unclean spirit, I
believe, and we were left with Uncle, who insisted on our
coming to the bar and making a meal. After that, at
about 5.30 a.m., we retired to the waiting-room, there to
glean what sleep we might in the three hours that were
left to us.</p>

<p class='c013'>From utter weariness I could have slept all day, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Uncle had no mercy. We were obliged to wake up at
seven. The door opened again, and a very ragged and
dirty young man lit the gas. He sprinkled some water
on the floor and swished a mop over it. He had no
boots or stockings on, but there were pieces of hard
sheepskin on the soles of his feet, and with these he
polished the floor, dancing and stamping, rubbing and
smoothing. Russian floors are generally of tessellated
wood and are polished in this manner. At eight we
had to wash and dress and go up to Uncle’s for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The deacon proposed to go to Lisitchansk directly
after breakfast. Uncle said we must have dinner first,
and then he would come also. I wanted to stay and
look around, so I proposed that Nicholas and I remain
with Uncle, and that the old folks and Zhenia might
go back if they wanted to and we would come on in
the afternoon. They agreed. Father, mother and
daughter went off in one sledge, Zhenia sitting on her
father’s knee, and we strolled away to the forest—“to
shoot wolves,” Uncle said.</p>

<p class='c013'>We passed through the village, a collection of mud
huts and pine izbas, all much poorer than Lisitchansk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come and spend the summer here,” said Uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, he’s coming to Lisitchansk,” said Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It doesn’t look very tempting,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, don’t judge by the present,” said Uncle, “we
are all sleeping like bears in their holes. We don’t
really wake up till the spring.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Yes, like bears,” said Nicholas. “Every nation
tends to take the characteristics of the animals amongst
which it lives; the Russians are like bears, the Indians
are like snakes, the Irish like pigs, the Australians like
kangaroos, the English like cows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense,” said Uncle; “the Russians are like
eagles, the English like lions—eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I agreed—the Russians were as much like eagles as
the English like lions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There aren’t any eagles in Russia except in the
Caucasus,” said Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that’s the place to go to, the Caucasus, full
of bears,” said Uncle.</p>

<p class='c013'>I laughed and pointed out that I was going to
Moscow first, there to finish the winter. The summer
was a long way off and I could foresee nothing. But
it was probably during this talk that it first occurred to
me to go to the Caucasus and tramp the mountains
there. Moscow, however, was the idea that forced
itself upon my consideration, for as soon as this Little-Russian
visit was completed I intended to go thither.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the forest we met the village moujiks, all engaged
in cutting timber and loading sledges, and Uncle amused
himself and us by feats of log-lifting. He was very
proud of his strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>At dinner-time his wife forbade him to go to Lisitchansk,
and he, after some protest about his promises,
obeyed her. The Christmas festival was evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>ending. The feasting and revelry of the past three
days was like a gay dream from which we were awaking,
awaking into a grey, ordinary world.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you go to the Caucasus come <i>via</i> Rubezhniya,”
said Uncle, as he kissed us in the sledge and bade us
good-bye.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />AMONG MOSCOW STUDENTS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_85_0_7 c015'>AT Kharkov, on my return journey, I recovered
half of my lost luggage; the other
half, a box full of books and papers, had
not turned up: neither by bribes nor by
words could it be found. We spent a whole day searching
the Customs House, but failed to find any trace of
it. I learned afterwards that it had been left behind
at Ostend, through the negligence of a porter there.
The loss of this box was a matter of sorrow. All
through the winter I felt the loss of it. It was only in
April, after immense correspondence, that I recovered
it, and then it was no use since I had made up my mind
to spend the summer on the mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>The loss of my overcoat and of my box had evidently
made a deep impression on Nicholas. He was determined
he should lose none of his things. We were
travelling together all the way to Moscow. He was
going to be a student at the University, and he hoped
to share lodgings with me. Our journey took three
days. Nicholas’s luggage consisted of nine heavy
portmanteaux and boxes. This luggage was a matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of amazement to myself, my fellow-travellers and the
porters. Surely no one ever before started from a pine
cottage with such an accumulation. How Nicholas
came by it all will always be an interesting page in his
life history.</p>

<p class='c013'>A year ago, Nicholas had been studying in Moscow
and supporting himself by giving lessons in English,
music and mathematics. Of all his studies the favourite
was English; and in English he excelled. His professor
regarded him as a lad of promise, and advised
him to go for a season to England and learn to speak
the language. Nicholas was of an adventurous spirit
and the advice pleased him. He saved a few pounds
and set off for England. First he went home and told
the deacon and his mother. They were astonished
beyond words. They did not, however, forbid the
journey; they blessed him and bade him farewell,
commending him to the saints. His mother kissed the
little Ikon which hung round his neck, and looked her
son in the eyes with that peculiar expression of faith
which is part of the In-itself of life. Zhenia kissed him
good-bye, and the young adventurer went out into the
wide world into the new lands. His route was interesting,
being the route which so many poor emigrants were
taking at that time, lured by the stories of fabulous
wages in England, America and Canada. He took
steamer at Ekaterinoslav and came leisurely up the
Dneiper to Kiev, the busy city generally spoken of as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>ancient, though new as Paris and swirling with electric
cars. From Kiev he went by train; third-class to the
Konigsberg frontier and thence across Germany, fourth-class
to Hamburg. Does the reader know a fourth-class
emigrant train? It is a series of cattle-trucks for
human beings, and indeed the occupants behave more
like animals than human beings. Anything more
filthy, indecent and odious than the condition of a Jews’
train can scarcely be imagined. I think Nicholas felt
very sick and weary before he got to Hamburg. But
it was cheap travelling. I think his whole fare, from
Lisitchansk to London, cost less than two pounds ten.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was a brave boy. I imagine his arrival in
London at the dreary docks, his first view of our appallingly
large, dreary city. He did not see the fairy-tale
which it is the fashion to see in London. It was a
friendless desert, a place where everyone was so poor
that it took all one’s time to look after oneself. He
wandered about and lost himself, if, indeed, it were
possible to lose himself, since he was already lost when
he arrived that early May morning. There was one
thing to do: he had a Russian’s address in his pocket,
the address of a Russian in London. By dint of asking
a new policeman at each turning he found his way to
Russell Square.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lucky boy! He fell on his feet in Bloomsbury in
the Russian colony there. Russians are very kind to
one another, and it would be difficult not to be kind to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Nicholas; he is handsome, witty, musical. One introduced
him to another all the way round, and he found
occupation easily, giving lessons once more in English,
music and mathematics. It was in this first period
that he met me. I had written to the Russian Consul
asking if he would recommend me a Russian who would
be willing to give me lessons in the Russian language.
He indicated a certain M. Voronofsky, who referred me
to Nicholas. So I came to know him. He was surely
the most affectionate teacher I ever had, and most
prodigal he was in Russian conversation. He gave me
hours beyond the stipulated time of my lesson, and
would walk arm-in-arm with me up and down the
Strand, protesting his affection and heaping endearments
upon me in a way that made me fancy what it is
like to be a girl. I was, however, in some respects unlucky
in my teachers; as fast as I got one he disappeared
and was next heard of in Barrow-in-Furness. The
reason for this lay in the fact that Messrs Vickers Maxim
had obtained a contract to build a portion of the new
Russian fleet. Besides an immense amount of correspondence
with the Russian Admiralty, all plans, specifications
and directions were in Russian, and in technical
Russian at that. Consequently a large Russian staff
was required at Barrow, and almost anyone who applied
was accepted at once. I told Nicholas of this, he applied
and was accepted. So for the time I lost him.
He worked three months, literally grinding, doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>twelve hours’ work a day. He found out what it was
to be utilised in the English machine. I think he did
not like it, and it was only the joy of earning a pile of
money that kept him at it. He made eighty pounds in
three months, which wasn’t bad for a youngster. But
at the end of that time a wave of home-sickness overtook
him. A letter from home said his father was
unwell; he interpreted it to mean his father was dying,
packed up his things and left the country. He had
arrived in London with one black box, he went away
with—nine heavy portmanteaux and trunks. He said
to me, when he came back from Barrow, “I want to buy
all sorts of things; if I don’t buy them now I shall never
buy them again; I shall never have the money.” Now,
to a Russian, England is a paradise of cheap clothes.
Living is dear but clothes are dirt cheap. In Russia
only my lord wears a collar or uses a handkerchief; an
English suit costs five pounds at least, English shirts
cost six or seven shillings each. Nicholas bought a
wardrobe of suits and fancy waistcoats, hats, boots,
umbrellas, ties. Such ties he bought that at several
Lisitchansk parties he had to undress partially so as to
satisfy the curiosity of his friends. He bought patent
Mikado braces, the like had never been seen in Little
Russia. He bought Zhenia a hat, and his father a smoking
jacket, and his mother a shawl. He bought reams
of delicately-tinted notepaper and envelopes, at which,
since those days, numberless fair Russian girls have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>gazed; though “fairer than the paper writ on was the
fair hand that writ.” I took him into Straker’s one
day to help him to make some purchases; we spent
half an hour selecting shades of sealing-wax. Well,
you can be sure that by the time he finished his packing
there was not much space left in those nine boxes and
bags. I saw him off at Liverpool Street Station. He
went home <i>via</i> the Hook of Holland and in grand style.
It was a strange contrast to his arrival five months before.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course he found his father very well when he came
to Lisitchansk, and he spent a very gay autumn there.
He was the prodigal come home, but with the fatted
calf under his arm. It was very glorious for him. Yet
from the point of view of material prosperity his return
was a mistake. The tide which leads to fortune had
been at the full for him in London. He had wilfully
neglected it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Success turned his head a little. He lived on glory
for a month or two, and then he heard that I was coming
to Russia and he invited me to his home. His mind
became full of plans: he would go to Canada, he would
go to England again, or to Chicago. The first step,
however, towards the realisation of these or any other
schemes was to obtain money. He had spent all his
English earnings.</p>

<p class='c013'>I came and stated my intention of going to Moscow.
Nicholas discovered that Moscow was the best place
for him. He would come with me and learn more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>English, and he would study for his degree and pay for
his living and his fees by giving lessons.</p>

<p class='c013'>He ought to have gone straight to Moscow in the
autumn, for the University year commences in September,
and the person who starts in January finds himself
hardly circumstanced in many ways. For one
thing, it is very difficult to earn money by teaching. It
is a custom in Russian families of the middle and upper
classes to employ what are known as <i>repetitors</i>. A
<i>repetitor</i> is a University student who comes each night
to hear the lessons in the family. The boys and girls
go to school in the morning, they prepare their home-lessons
in the afternoon, and in the evening and at night
they say them over to <i>repetitors</i>. A student of ability
has a fair chance of earning eight or ten pounds a month
by this, and there is scarcely a student in Moscow who
does not glean two or three pounds at least by it. But
practically the whole of this teaching is arranged in
September or October, at the commencement of the
session, for all schools work in harmony with the
University and have the same terms and vacations.
So Nicholas was coming out of time. In truth, neither
his prospect nor mine would have tempted an investor.
But neither of us understood the position, and each
relied a little on the other. Nicholas thought my
journalism would bring me in untold wealth, and I
thought I might be able to get some teaching through
him. So the blind led the blind.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>At Moscow we were met by Shura, a Little-Russian
friend of Nicholas; Alexander Sergayef was his name in
full, though he was called Shura or Sasha for short. He
was a philological student and shared rooms with a
Greek in the Kislovka. The three of us drove to a
lodging-house at Candlemas Gate (Sretinka Vorota),
and the portmanteaux and boxes followed behind on a
dray.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lodging-house goes by the name of “Samarkand,”
which is printed on a disreputable blue board
which hangs outside. It is a dirty establishment like
five hundred of its kind in the city. The lodgers are
chiefly clerks and students, and, before the Governor
stepped in with new regulations, card-sharpers and
gamblers. One commonly collided with queer characters
on the stairs—beggars, spies, touts; girls in gay
hats hung on the banisters, smoked cigarettes, flirted
with the doorkeeper and the students. In front the
building looked down upon a beer-tavern; behind it
stood the Candlemas Monastery, a church of cheese-yellow
and bottle-green, surrounded by seven purple
domes. On each dome was a gilt cross, and on the cross
fat crows often perched. We took a room on the third
floor; it cost two pounds a month—a very cheap price
for Moscow. It was an advantage to us to be nearer
the sky than the street; we had light and air and view.
We had more cold, perhaps, but that was a minor
matter. No town houses have fire-places except rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>mansions built in the English style, but there is excellent
steam-heating, and even on the coldest days we never
felt a chill, though we were high up and exposed to the
wind. For me, indeed, it was a most pleasant experience
to be able to turn out of bed in the morning and
feel the room as warm as it was when I went to bed.
Russian houses, even the poorest, are more comfortable
in winter than the English.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our room was a large one, having five chairs and
three rickety little tables, besides a couple of couches
and two beds. In a grey corner an Ikon of the Virgin
hung. I, for my part, had my own Ikon, a print of
Millet’s “Angelus,” which I placed in front of my table.
It made even this poor room a living, breathing home.
It was my reminder of England. Since those days when
I lived at Samarkand it has become very sacred to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were very poor. I think when I had bought an
overcoat and Nicholas had paid his fees we had just
three pounds between us. We lived on black bread,
milk and fried pork. I wrote my articles, he went and
hawked about the town for lessons.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the precious things in the capacious pockets of
that overcoat which was stolen was a book on the
<i>Russian Peasant</i>. This had been given me by a London
editor who let me have “a shot at reviewing it.” I
grieved not a little that this had been lost before I had
read it thoroughly. I had only glanced through it in
the train. My loss did not deter me from writing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>article, however. What was my surprise when in the
second week of my stay at Moscow, almost by return
of post, the editor wrote, “Review excellent, fire away,
try something else.” I felt very cheerful and reflected
that by mid-February at the latest I should receive my
first cheque.</p>

<p class='c013'>But meanwhile it became apparent that we stood a
chance to starve. We were living on an average of
less than fourpence a day each. In a note-book, which
I kept at that time, I see that on January 14th I
spent 5d. on food, on the 15th, 4d. The figures are
interesting:—</p>

</table>
<p class='c019'>and so on.</p>
<p class='c013'>On the 28th Shura came round to see us, told us his
Greek companion had left him, and invited us to come
and live with him. Forthwith the three of us, the nine
boxes and bags and my luggage, proceeded in sledges
to the Kislovka, and we took up our abode in the
students’ quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The district known as the Kislovka lies at the back
of the University. It is an ugly aggregation of lodging-houses.
Each lodging-house is composed of students’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>dens. Some students have rooms to themselves, but
for the most part a single one is let to two or three
students. Three young men, like ourselves, will sleep,
eat, study and receive company in the same room. We
had to pay about fourteen shillings a month each, so
the arrangement seemed more economical. Then
Shura earned about four pounds a month giving lessons,
so the financial position was much improved. Then, on
the second night after we had been there, Nicholas won
fifteen shillings off a Frenchman at cards. Then on
February 5th there came a letter to me from a London
newspaper enclosing a cheque in respect of a Christmas
article I had sent in. It was too late for this Christmas,
they would use it next. It was evident we should not
starve.</p>

<p class='c013'>On Saturday Shura had an “At Home” day. We
always stayed up all night on Saturdays. In the afternoons
we bought rolls and sausage and caviare and
tinned herring and cheese to make a spread. About five
or six o’clock the guests would arrive—five or six girl
students and the same number of men. There were
not chairs to go round, so many of them sat on the beds.
Then we talked in the way that only Russians can. On
the floor lay cigarette-ends, volumes on law and philosophy,
dust of past ages, vodka droppings from the last
gathering, old clothes, newspapers, picture postcards.
The walls were plastered with prints, portraits of
members of the Duma, a large newspaper picture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Tolstoy, cartoons from European papers, etc. My
“Angelus” Ikon looked almost sorrowfully upon the
scene. There was no real Russian Ikon there. Shura
told me he had pitched it out of the window when he
came. He didn’t believe in God. In the course of the
evening one of the students present would read a tale
from Tchekhof or Andrief, another would read a few
verses from Nadson, their favourite poet. Nicholas
would play on the guitar and sing little Russian songs.
I would get through a game at chess with someone.
Then we would all play some games at forfeit with the
girls. The time passed very quickly. One samovar
would succeed another until after midnight, and glasses
of weak tea circulated till dawn. At last we would
take the girls home, and then come back and sleep an
hour or two before breakfast. It was a godless way of
beginning the Sunday.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly after the first “At Home” I discovered a
way in which an Englishman can make a small fortune
in Moscow. I put an advertisement in the <i>Russian
Word</i> to this effect:—</p>

<p class='c020'>“Young Englishman from London, well-educated,
seeks lessons, speaks French and Russian.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The answers to this soon made me the richest of the
three in the little room. My lowest price was four
shillings a lesson of one hour. An Englishman can get
that easily in Moscow. I became a <i>repetitor</i>. First I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a French girl to teach, the daughter of a cotton manufacturer.
She didn’t like me and I lost that lesson
after a fortnight, but I got lessons with an engineer,
with two German boys and a Russian boy; and a
woman engaged me to give a series of lectures on English
literature at a girls’ college. For the last named I
received six shillings a lecture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Nicholas got three pounds a month to coach a
boy for his matriculation; we were all thriving.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c015'>IN February Moscow was overrun by an epidemic
of typhus. It did not spring from the frozen
drains so much as from the indigestible black
bread which is sold in the poorer parts of the
city. On 10th February I gave up black bread for
ever; I have not eaten it since—at least not Moscow
black bread; Caucasian black bread is another matter.
The bread diet had become too much for me. I lay in
bed all one day feeling more dead than alive, and the
prospect of typhus seemed very real. I recovered,
and then substituted porridge and milk for the old diet.
I showed Shura and Nicholas how to make this in the
Scotch way, and they got very keen on it and showed
other students. So I might almost claim to have introduced
Scotch porridge to Moscow University. The
Russian peasants and poor people in general make a
porridge of buck-wheat, <i>Kasha</i> they call it, but I am
quite sure it is less cheap, less wholesome, and less tasty
than oatmeal porridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moscow in winter is remarkable for its poor people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>its labourers, its beggars, its students. Cab-drivers
in Moscow take twopence-halfpenny a mile, and I have
frequently taken a sledge from Sukareva Tower to the
Vindavsky Station for fifteen copecks—4d., a distance
of two miles. At the Khitry market one may often
see men and women with only one cotton garment
between their bodies and the cruel cold. How they
live is incomprehensible; they are certainly a different
order of being from anything in England. And the
beggars! They say there are 50,000 of them. The
city belongs to them; if the city rats own the drains,
they own the streets. They are, moreover, an essential
part of the city; they are in perfect harmony with it;
take away the beggars and you would destroy something
vital. Some are so old and weather-battered that
they make the Kremlin itself look older, and those who
lie at the monastery doors are so fearfully pitiable in
their decrepitude that they lend power to the churches.
Moscow would be a different place without the gaunt
giants who hang down upon one and moan for bread;
without the little cripples who squirm upon the pavement
and scream their wants at the passer-by. To me,
though I found them a plague at first, they were a perpetual
interest. There were among them some of the
strangest people one could expect to meet anywhere:
worn-out, yellow-whiskered men with icicles in their
beards, limbless trunks of men, abortions of men and
women. I saw many nationalities; Letts, Poles, Jews,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Tartars, Tatars, Bohemians, Caucasians, Chinese,
Bokharese, specimens of all the peoples who exist under
the Russian Eagle. Rich Russians allege that they
collect five shillings a day, which is on a par with the
tales of wealth amassed by organ-grinders in London.
The daily task of each is to obtain twopence—a penny
for a pound of black bread, a penny for a bed in a night
house. They just about manage this, sometimes getting
a little more, sometimes a little less. The surplus goes
in vodka.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question has to be faced by the traveller—What
are you going to do with the beggars? I felt the
need of a definite policy. At first, when we ourselves
were near starving, I said “<i>No</i>” consistently, for I hadn’t
any money. Then when money came I hardened my
heart and said, “It is better to be a thief than a beggar:
it is more manly. If I give to beggars I make it more
profitable to be a beggar; I attract other people to
beggary. If I withhold my money I drive some beggars
to robbery, and then the police have to deal with them.”
If the people were properly looked after there would be
no need to rob or beg. This was a clear decision, and
I held by it rigorously for a long time, till at last I came
to the conclusion that it was more unpleasant to refuse
some beggars than to give alms. Truly, whether an
Englishman gives or gives not he feels he does wrong.
Eventually I abandoned my principle and gave when I
felt inclined. The Russian has no mental scruples.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>He is generally, providentially, ignorant of the science
of economics. One fact is evident to him: the beggar
is cold and hungry and it is Christian to help him. And
the Socialists are too busy over bigger things to define
their attitude to the poor wretch whom they deem to be
a victim of tyranny. It is a common happening to see
a crowd of unfortunate creatures being driven to the
police-station by a couple of soldiers. To the democrat
that is sufficient evidence of tyranny. Still, I have
been told the beggars have nothing to fear from the
authorities. The beggar is a holy institution; he keeps
down the rate of wages in the factories; he is the pillar
of the church, for he continually suggests charity; he
is necessary to the Secret Police; where else could they
hide their spies?</p>

<p class='c013'>The beggars have the most extraordinary licence
and think nothing of walking in at a back-door and
staring at you for a quarter of an hour. It is this
licensed insolence that makes him a terror to the nervous
Russian, who always considers himself watched by
spies. Nicholas appeared to be continually suspecting
and dreading spies. On the second day after we
arrived at the Samarkand lodging-house he discovered
a spy on the same floor, so he said. Often when I was
walking with him in the town he would say to me in a
whisper, “Slow down and let the man behind us get
past.” Once we slowed down in vain, and then put
on speed in vain; we could not rid ourselves of a beggar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>who persisted in following us. Nicholas suddenly
turned round in terror at a dark corner and clutched
hold of the beggar with both hands and shook him.
Then it was the beggar’s turn to have a fright, but he
only asked meekly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why did you do that to me, barin?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The word “barin,” “bar,” means a master; it is interesting
that the word spelt backwards, <i>rab</i>, means a
slave. Russians say this is not merely a coincidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The different way in which beggars address one
would make an interesting study. I remember one
night a dreadful amorphous remnant of a man, lying in
a currant box outside the Cathedral of St Saviour,
addressed me in this fashion:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Imagine that I am God!”</p>

<p class='c013'>One seldom, however, hears such a dramatic utterance.
Much commoner is lighter banter. I remember
a cheeky boy came up to me smiling and certain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A copeck, dear count!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Haven’t got one, your Majesty,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the beggars have a selection of tales of woe
carefully worked up to suit the susceptibilities of different
passers-by. Of this kind was an old stalwart
whom we, of the Kislovka room, used to patronise.
His usual style was:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was a soldier at the Turkish War and astonished
three generals by my bravery, but now devil a penny
will my country give me to keep my old bones together.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>But the two girl students who occupied the room
next to ours always averred that he told them a yarn
about his daughter dying from want of food and his
wife in consumption, but never said a word about his
exploits.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nicholas and I dressed ourselves in our worst and
went to a night-house one night. At five o’clock in the
evening there was a queue like a first night pit-crowd
at His Majesty’s Theatre in London, a street full of
beggars pushing, jostling, shouting and singing. Next
door to the doss-house was a tavern, to which every
now and then someone unable to oppose temptation
would dash to get a glass of vodka. Admission to this
house cost one penny. It was rather a fearsome den
to go into, and I wonder at ourselves now. I thought
we should be too far down the line to get in, but I
was mistaken. Everyone was admitted. We passed
through a turnstile, and, strange to say, showed no
passports. I fancy most of the beggars are passport-less.
A policeman stood at the door and scrutinised
the face of each who passed in. He had had too much
vodka to do this to any great effect, and he let us
through without demur, probably taking us for famished
students, if he thought about us at all. Directly we
got in we were confronted by a huge bar stocked with
basins. A boy was serving out cabbage soup at a
farthing a basinful. Another boy was serving out
<i>kasha</i>, also at a farthing a basin. On a green noticeboard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>among an array of vodka bottles, I read the
following queer price-list:</p>

</table>
<p class='c013'>The doss-house was owned by a merchant who
made a handsome profit out of it, I am told. So well
he might! The accommodation was <i>nil</i>. Straw to
sleep upon. No chairs beyond three park seats. Two
rooms lit by two jets of gas each. A small lavatory
that might even make a beggar faint. Men and
women slept in the same room, though they were, for
the most part, so degraded that it scarcely occurred to
one that they were of different sex.</p>

<p class='c013'>We went upstairs; the air seemed a trifle less
odorous there. Even there we agreed it was impossible
to stay. About a hundred beggars were already
asleep, and most of the rest were making themselves
comfortable.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a large dark room, unventilated, and having
all the windows sealed with putty, so that not the
slightest draught of air came through. There were, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>course, no fires in the room; it was heated by hot-water
pipes. One would say the floor had not been cleaned
since the day it was first used. It was rotten and
broken and covered with black slime. The snow from
the beggars’ boots melted in the warm room, as it had
done every night this winter. Huge gnawn holes in the
cornice showed where the rats had been. Yet in this
den, on such a floor, human beings lay and slept! Pigs
would have been housed better.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet in a gloomy corner opposite the entrance a
little lamp burned before the sacred picture of Jesus.
The Ikon stood there and looked upon the scene. It
seemed to say, “God is here also, He does not disclaim
even this; and in His sight even these are men and have
souls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A Socialist government would make a difference
in a place like this. The walls would be of white tiles
and would shine like a station on the electric railway.
There would be couches and mattresses, parqueted
floors, electric light, baths, a reading-room next door, a
free restaurant below. And there would be no Ikon.
They would feel they didn’t need the sanction of God
for what the reason approved.</p>

<p class='c013'>I said this to Nicholas. He had bought a bottle of
vodka, and was treating a man who said he was an ex-student
and literary man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t we enjoy ourselves!” said the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nice mess they’d make of it,” said Nicholas.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“They’d have to clean the beggars and dress them, and
then shut up the pawnshops and the vodka shops, and
then give them some work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“None of the beggars will do any work in the
winter,” said the man; “there are workhouses already,
but they won’t go there. There’s more fun on the
streets, and then our work is more acceptable to God;
we keep the people charitable. We stand outside
taverns and theatres and tobacconists, and by our
poverty remind the customers of God’s blessings. We
restrain their self-indulgence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was evidently an impossible line of argument.
I asked him how the people came to be beggars. In his
case it was vodka, and he had met scores of students
reduced to the same plight. Most of the beggars were
just tramp labourers, in the summer they would go to
the country again; the women were the off-scourings
of the streets. There were many more women beggars
than men, but they died off more quickly. “The
<i>intelligentia</i> of Moscow lead such a life,” said he. “The
very Socialists, who want to make the place clean, lead
dirty lives themselves. Look at the hundreds of girls
shouting themselves deaf on the Tverskoe Boulevard,
look at the students arm-in-arm with them,
think of the average middle-class Russian’s life. He
gorges himself with food, rots his mind with
French novels, and openly confesses what women are
to him.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“We shall have to get rid of the reformers before we
shall reform Russia,” said Nicholas, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I don’t blame them,” said the beggar; “it’s
all part of life; we beggars are all manure, that’s what
we are; they plaster us about the roots of Society and
make the little red blossoms grow—and the white
blossoms.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all very dirty,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One learns to understand dirt, to love it even.
God made the dirt; see how the picture looks down, the
eyes don’t blink.” He pointed to the Ikon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dirt is part of the Russian harmony,” I suggested
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said the beggar, “perhaps one day it will all
be different, and we shall have a vote and pay taxes and
have jobs as well as wives and families. But, you know,
‘you must love us whilst we are dirty, for everyone will
love us when we are clean.’”</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />A NIGHT AT A SHRINE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'>LIFE at Moscow was very full during the
ensuing two months. What the students
did I did. Each night there was some
new diversion; a visit to the Narodny
Dom with dancing and confetti fights until three in the
morning, or a skating masquerade at Chisty Prudy.
Sometimes we would go in sledges to Petrovsky Park;
other times we would go to the Kremlin and climb up
the steeple of St John’s. These days were full of
variety and entertainment. One evening I presented
myself at the stage-door of the Theatre of Art; I could
not find the box-office. Stanislavsky’s company was
performing <i>The Life of Man</i>. An actor met me and I
asked him how I should get a ticket. But, when he discovered
I was an Englishman, he took me to the
manager, and got me a free pass to the third row of the
stalls. That was glorious hospitality. It was a magnificent
performance; the stage management was
perfect if extremely ingenious. Another night a Russian
girl asked me to take her to the Hermitage Theatre;
she was going anyway, but she needed a “cavalier.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>So we went and listened to four French farces, all
performed the same night. Katia, for so she was
called, was a Georgian and talked to me of the
Caucasus all the time we promenaded. In Russian
theatres one has a quarter of an hour’s promenade
after each act. We were supposed to be immensely
smitten with one another, and ignorant of the state
of my heart she said sweetly, as we were in the sledge
going home, “You were a quiet boy and I awakened
you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Among a number of expeditions, visiting factory
owners, tobogganing at Sokolniky, or skiing, one adventure
stands out more vividly than the others.
Phrosia, a lame woman who cooked for us in our Kislovka
room, had warned us she wouldn’t be at home for
two days. She was going away to pray. Shura wanted
to know why she couldn’t remain in Moscow to pray,
but she only looked at him very solemnly and said her
mother had always prayed at Troitsky Lavra that day
and so would she. I resolved to accompany her. The
account of my pilgrimage which I wrote at the time will
show the sequel.</p>

<div class='c021'>“<span class='sc'>Sergievo</span>, 2.30 a.m.</div>

<p class='c022'>“This is written in the waiting-room here. Before
me the lights twinkle on the little vodka bar. There is
much noise in the room, but the heavy sound of snoring
is gaining the victory over all. What a night this has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>been! How came I here? How is it that I still live?
To-night—the first act was among crowds of pilgrims
at church; the second act in a one-room cottage framed
in old newspapers and inhabited by five men, two
women and two babies (thoughts of plague and exit!);
the third act was spent among the churches and the
stars in the cool, fresh night; fourth act, discovery of
the railway station full of people drunk or sleeping;
the fifth act is to come. I am drinking my eleventh
glass of tea from the inexhaustible pot, but ah! how
restless I am! I am sure I carry on my person many of
the unnumbered inhabitants of that cottage. How the
insects creaked in its newspaper walls! About me now,
picture fearful, monstrous peasants spluttering, roaring,
singing. A gentleman comes along now and then and
pretends to keep order. My <i>vis-à-vis</i> is uproarious.
Figure him with thick red hair and wild red beard. He
is a fat man and he stands facing the <i>gendarme</i> and
answers each remonstrance with an inarticulate roar.
Rrrr! His hair has been cut away with shears, and it
overhangs his head equally all round like the straw of a
thatched cottage.</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Make w-way, will you,’ said the peasant to me
with a voice like thunder.</p>

<p class='c022'>“I smiled gently. The peasant frowned and twisted
his red lips under his tangled moustache. He leaned
down and brought his wild phiz close up to mine and
leered into my eyes. I could not have dreamed of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>more terrifying face. It recalled to me the dreadful
thoughts of my childhood as to what might be the face
of the Black Douglas or the Bogey Man.</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Make way, will you, or I’ll cut your throat,’ he
roared.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Several of his companions warned him that the
<i>gendarme</i> was listening.</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘You’re not very polite,’ I said. ‘What is it you
want?’</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘There’s no room for me anywhere else.’</p>

<p class='c022'>“I made a place for him and he took it without a
word. He became immediately content and self-absorbed
like a babe that, after crying and kicking, has
found its mother’s breast.</p>

<p class='c022'>“He is now sitting with both elbows on the table.
In one hand he grasps a fish tightly; he held that fish
in his hand all the time he was confronting me. Ah!
Now he is yelling to the counter for vodka. He is a
rough customer. A tall labourer in a red shirt bent
over to me just now and asked me if I knew what his
name was.</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘His name is Dung.’</p>

<p class='c022'>“Everyone in the room laughed. Even the <i>gendarme</i>
grinned. The peasant repeated his joke. It was
evidently his only stock and store. Perhaps his
father taught him that joke, and he in his turn had it
from his grandfather. He is at this moment addressing
the peasant of the human thatch.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“‘Mr Dung, ha, ha, ha. Your Excellency Baron
Dung, a word with you, ha, ha, ha,’ etc. etc. etc. But,
strange to say, my antagonist pays no attention whatever,
but regards his fish and his, as yet, untasted,
vodka with the eye of an expert mathematician
who is pondering some more-than-usually-interesting
problem.</p>

<p class='c022'>“There has not been much occasion for <i>ennui</i> since
I came in here. A Lettish pedlar has come in, he has
a face like an American music-hall hobo, a tramp
artiste. So you would say to see his high-arched eyebrows
and his long mouth. But he is a poor starved
wretch, and there may be some truth in his reiterated
assertion that he has been robbed of three farthings.
If he doesn’t stop screeching out that fact the <i>gendarme</i>
is likely to throw him out or take him to the
‘lock-up.’ My attention is divided between him and a
girl at the bar. During the last ten minutes a peasant
lass has taken five glasses of vodka, and a well-dressed
man, himself drunk, is making clumsy attempts to kiss
her. She grins and reels about—a country girl. She
smiles idiotically and tries to steer her cheek and lips
away from the man’s moustache. If he were a little
less unsteady on his feet he would have no difficulty, I
am sure. The man is making us all a speech now, and
the peasants are jesting according to their knowledge
of jests. The <i>gendarme</i> strolls fretfully up and down,
his fingers twitching. Oh, my acquaintance with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>one joke has risen and is addressing the man who has
been ‘treating’ the girl. He caught hold of the man
with the thatched head; the latter rose, thinking the
policeman wanted him. But no!</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Allow me to introduce you to Mr—’</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Here, I’ve heard enough of that, you go out,’
says the <i>gendarme</i>, and grasps the joking man to put
him out.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Then up speaks the pedlar.</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Please, Mr Gendarme, he stole three farthings of
mine.’</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Yes?’ replies the policeman. ‘Then you must
both come to the police-station.’ He blows his whistle
vigorously. There is a crowd of moujiks round him.
The man with the thatched head has sunk back sleepily
into his seat. I hear him murmuring gently, ‘Cut his
throat, cut his throat.’ Two other <i>gendarmes</i> are here
now, and the two prisoners are being kicked out with
great turbulence.</p>

<p class='c022'>“A furious noise, and yet many men and women are
lying fast asleep among the bundles on the floor. The
bar-tender moves hither and thither behind his orderly
rows of glass bottles and is quite at his ease. He is
bringing me an extra pennyworth of sugar now! In
the darkest corner of the waiting-room an elaborate
temple is set up and little lamps burn dimly before the
gilded Ikons of Mary and the child Jesus. The drunkards
look thither furtively and cross themselves. The scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>is strange. I was rummaging through my pocket-book
just now for some paper and came across the photograph
of dear K——. I took it out and let the face
look into the room. I felt convulsed with laughter at
the wistful way she looked out upon the scene; the
print is fading slightly, and there is a sort of ‘silken, sad,
uncertain’ expression about it that was so astonishingly
true that the real face could not look differently if my
friend could be instantly brought here. But she sleeps
peacefully in that London suburb that I know. Fourteen
hours to wait for a train! And what shall I do this
long day? I might walk back again to Moscow, thirty-five
versts is not far, but it has come to my mind that I
shall not walk this stretch. It has been a rough
jaunt.</p>

<p class='c022'>“This room with its vodka bar and its temple of
God, and the drunkards flung all around the steps of the
altar, is a picture of Russia—of an aspect of Russia.
When I came into the village this afternoon the sacred
Ikons were being borne in procession through the streets,
and services were being conducted at street corners.
Two priests were detailed off to officiate at this station.
I saw them go in through the throng of the bare-headed
crowd. Dressed in cloth of gold and mitred in
purple, they moved about majestically in the performance
of their office, and from their mouths came the
unearthly sounds in which it is orthodox to clothe the
words of their litany. Pilgrimages are made to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>shrine on each great fast day. Many thousands flock
hither from Moscow and from the country round about;
some come on foot, some by train, and some in sledges.
I came by train, third-class, with our cook; she is now
somewhere sleeping in an unheavenly cottage there
below. It has been interesting to see the far-distance
pilgrims; the peasant women bent double by huge
bundles on their backs, but resting on stout staffs and
looking out very piously and anciently from their deep
hoods. We had four of them in our carriage in the train;
very gay they looked in their coloured cotton dresses;
but they were reserved, and their monosyllabic groans
and grunts scarcely sounded articulate outside the
circle of their own company. The service last evening
was grand; the festival commenced at six o’clock; I
had been watching the crows whirling about the domes
of the churches, settling on the high gilt crosses, flapping
their wings, balancing themselves, calling to one
another, and the dusk was deepening. I went into the
great church and looked at the long queue of people
waiting to consecrate their candles and be anointed with
the holy oil. At last the priests came forward and lit
one candle before each of the Ikons, and a long-haired
pope stood before the people and pronounced the induction
of the service. The choir voices swelled in
unison as the incense reached one’s senses, and the
solemn litany went forward with its eternal choric
response: ‘Oh, Lord, have mercy, oh, Lord, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>mercy.’ ‘<i>Gospody pomeely, Gospody pomeely.</i>’ ...
And now and then the priest would repeat the words
so rapidly that it sounded like gospodipity, gospodipity.</p>

<p class='c022'>“About ten o’clock I left the dim church and went
out into the darkness, among shadows of unknown men
and women and bundles. A hundred yards distant a
bright window gave a full light on to the night. A
tavern was there, ‘where stood a company with heated
eyes,’ a wild, hairy people who stormed and screamed
and fell about. A glass of tea for me, also a bottle of
black-currant water; the like of the latter we shall not
drink again. No room to sit there. The street without
was full of solicitous boys and girls who wanted to find
you a lodging. To one of these I had recourse, and after
many unsuccessful ventures she took me to the fore-mentioned
cottage. There was more adventure and
novelty than sleep on the bill of fare, and I was tempted.
When one carries a portable bed one is fairly independent,
but why had I no misgivings here? The great
winter stove on which the good woman of the place bakes
her bread had been at full heat all day, and the men and
women who lay there were like lumps of flesh in a thick
stew of air. On the torn newspaper ceiling the flies
walked about or buzzed down to settle on the faces of
the sleepers. The place of honour was given me, the
one bed with a rag of curtain. I was blessed and
prayed for before the cottage Ikons, which were set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>up in a further corner—perhaps I had need for
prayer....</p>

<p class='c022'>“At midnight, having passed through many adventures,
I evacuated the position. Much difficulty
there was among the legs of the sleepers, but an exit
was achieved, and presently there was a ceiling of stars
above me and a cold breeze about. The cottage being
in the middle of a field there was some further difficulty
in extrication. Then came a series of <i>rencontres</i>.
First a beggar, very drunk, and whirling a cudgel above
his head, tells me he knows me, has seen me in Moscow.
(I wondered if, perhaps, he had actually seen me at
the night-house with Nicholas.) Then a <i>gendarme</i>
presents a bold aspect but falls back judiciously since
I do not hesitate in my stride. I am a suspicious-looking
character. Watchmen-monks, with the night
breeze blowing their long hair about (the clergy all wear
long hair), I have encounters with these. But the night
was very good and full of music; never so many stars,
never such a Milky Way or such black unstarry patches,
and the air was thrilling. The newspaper cottage was
far away. Presently I discovered the railway station
and the waiting-room full of people, and here I am. It
will soon be dawn. I have poured myself out the
twelfth and thirteenth glasses of tea, very like hot
water and without sugar or milk. If I have caught any
malady at the cottage I should be saved by this internal
washing. I become the latest convert to the system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Dr Sangrado of <i>Gil Blas</i> memory.... Two priests
have arrived in the waiting-room....</p>

<p class='c022'>“Ah! I hear that, after all, there will be a train
home soon.</p>

<p class='c022'>“I left the station at a run and was back at the
newspaper cottage, and a half-dressed, half-sleeping
woman let me in, got me my things and asked mournfully
why it was I could not sleep.</p>

<p class='c022'>“‘Was it too hot, barin?’</p>

<p class='c022'>“She blessed me and let me depart.</p>

<p class='c022'>“Now the little village was in movement, the church
bell was sounding and many little bells were tinkling;
and many sleepy folks were making their way to church,
for at dawn another great service commenced. At the
waiting-room a service was begun. And now the night
gave way to early dusk, and the dark churches became
dimly visible; the sleepy peasants rubbed their eyes.
Presently a glorious sunrise began to flush upon the
gold and silver Ikons, and softly and lowly with the in-coming
light the services in the churches proceeded, in
sweet, melancholy music. The faces of the worshippers
became less shadowy, and at last all was in full day.
Then, too, my lazy train steamed away, and Sergievo
and last night were both behind me.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE DAY AFTER THE FEAST</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c015'>THE day after a church festival is always the
Feast of St Lombard. Outside all the
pawnbrokers’ establishments one sees
crowds of poor people drawn up in line—men,
women, children, but mostly women. It is a
pitiable sight. Each person is carrying the article to
be pledged, and whether it be a samovar or a chair, or a
petticoat or a pair of trousers, it is never wrapped up.
Russians are not ashamed. The queue which I saw
near the Tverskaya a street long, the day after my
return from Sergievo, would have been thought a disgrace
to any English city, but the Russians looked on
with equanimity. And to walk from end to end, from
the pawnbroker’s door to the last person who has just
hurried up with a pledge, was like reading a chapter from
the darkest pages of Gorky. One sees children of sad
aspect, with bewildered eyes; young girls as yet honest
and clean, but selling the last things of a home; raging
women, weeping women and laughing women,
drunkards and drudges; or besotted men of the sort
who drink away their wives’ and daughters’ honour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>hopeless home thieves who would steal away even the
clothes from a bed and turn them into vodka. It is
notable that in Russia, as yet, it is chiefly the men who
drink; a drunken woman is very rare. The woman in
Russia is the wisest and strongest person in the home.
One poor woman, stout and rubicund, but of countenance
preternaturally solemn, seemed to me weighed
down with responsibility. She had a copper samovar
under her arm, and I asked her what misfortune had
overtaken her. It was the old story; her husband was a
cabman, he ought to have taken no holiday yesterday,
the streets were full of people and he might have had
many fares, but he went to a tavern in the morning,
and spent all his money and fought with a man and was
arrested by a <i>gendarme</i>. I asked her how much she
would get “on” the samovar. “Seventy-five copecks,
barin,” she replied. “Have you got another samovar?”
I asked. “No, barin, we shall have to borrow water;
I don’t know what the table will look like without
the samovar, it won’t be home without it, it has
always been on the table; it was my mother’s, and
she gave it me when I was married. I am sure we
shall never have good fortune after the samovar has
gone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I lent her seventy-five copecks—one shilling and
sixpence—and told her to take her beloved samovar
home again. She accepted without hesitation. She
put the samovar down on the pavement and embraced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>me with both arms. “Bless you, barin, the Lord bless
you; come along and have some tea.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I went to her poor little home—two rooms—in
which there was no furniture beyond the bed, a table,
some boxes and the Ikons. Two pallid, starved
daughters, girls of thirteen and sixteen, smiled sweetly
and made themselves happy over our party. I had
bought some <i>barankas</i>, dry Russian biscuits, <i>en
route</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The woman told me the story of how her husband
had nearly been cured of drunkenness by God. A year
or two ago a most holy priest at Sergievo had been
empowered by God to cure drunkenness. Thousands
and thousands, tens of thousands of drunkards had
made pilgrimages from Moscow and Kiev and Odessa
and the country, and had been cured by the priest by
miracle, and Vania had gone from Moscow and had
been a whole month sober, because of the prayer of the
holy man. Then suddenly the holy man was removed
and Vania got drunk again.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was like this. Vania went on foot to Sergievo
and saw the monk. First he was anointed, and then
received communion, and then he went to the priest’s
house, where he had to tell his story to the holy man.
Then they prayed before the Ikon that God would have
mercy upon Vania. After the prayer the priest rose
and said, “God knows now that you want to become
sober and lead a new life. You must remember that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>He is looking at you particularly, just as He would at
a new plant that was beginning to bud. To-day He
sees you all White and beautiful, and He says to the
angels, ‘Look at my servant Vania, how well he is living.’
Each morning and evening God will say how much
brighter and more beautiful he is becoming.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Slav Bogou</i>, Glory be to God,” replied Vania.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said the priest, “for how many days can
you keep sober, for how many days can you live without
touching a drop of beer or vodka?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For ever, a thousand days,” replied Vania.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A thousand days is only three years; it’s not for
ever,” said the priest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Vania blinked his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You must kneel on your knees and swear to God
that you will not drink,” said the priest. “But if you
break the vow it will be very dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said Vania, “I shall swear it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are very weak,” said the priest; “you must
pray God each morning when you get up and each night
before you go to bed that He may give you strength.
Perhaps you will fail, perhaps you are lost, but God is
going to give you a chance. He’s going to watch you
for one week first, for one little week. You must swear
to God that you will not drink vodka or beer for one
week.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Vania, on his knees, repeated the oath after the
priest.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Rise now, Vania,” said the priest; “I think you
will keep this little oath, but if you feel you can’t you
must come straight to me and I will release you. You
mustn’t break it. I can let you off quite easily if you
come to me. But if you break it, God may strike you
dead, or He may give you to the Devil. The Devil
would be very glad to have you, Vania, but it would
be very bad for you. To-day is Sunday; I shan’t be
angry if you come to me to-morrow or on Tuesday and
say, ‘Release me, father.’ I will then release you and
pray God to have mercy on you and to send angels to
help you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Vania went away and kept his vow on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, but on Friday, a very
cold day, he wanted a drink very badly. Comrades
laughed at him, too. He drove up and down the city
and got only one little fare the whole morning. There
were fifteen copecks in his pocket. He might get two
glasses for that. Every tavern tempted, and the Devil
seemed waiting at every tavern-door. At two o’clock
he drove home quickly and gave the fifteen copecks
to his wife; at half-past two he rushed home again
and begged the fifteen copecks back. He entered the
shop and placed his bottle on the counter and
asked for vodka. The woman behind the railing of
the “monopoly” counter stepped back to pick out
what he wanted, and at that moment Vania, all
of a tremble, looked up and saw the holy Ikon in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>shop, a figure of Christ staring at him. The woman,
when she brought the bottle, thought the customer
had a fit, for he suddenly shrieked and bolted from
the shop.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Lord, have mercy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>On Friday night Vania saw the priest again and
asked to be released. The priest praised him and
prayed with him and offered him release, and then
Vania would not take it. He asked to swear again.
So he was sworn in again and this time for ten
days.</p>

<p class='c013'>Vania went home and prayed, and successfully resisted
temptation for ten days, and very proud he was
at the end of that time when he returned to the holy
man and the latter praised him and hung a sign of God
by a little chain round his neck.</p>

<p class='c013'>The priest prayed with him again and sent him
away for a fortnight on the same conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Vania was sober in this way for a whole month, and
all his family with him, and he prospered with his cab
and bought their furniture out of pawn. God was
evidently very pleased with Vania.</p>

<p class='c013'>But at the end of that time a catastrophe happened.
Vania went to the shrine to be re-confirmed in his new
life, and behold the priest was not there any more. He
had been removed by the Bishop, and no one knew
where he had gone to. There was unutterable
sadness and despair in the crowds of drunkards

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />A MUSHROOM FAIR IN LENT</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;HAD been out one morning looking at St
Saviour’s and tasting the March sunshine, and
I returned to the Kislovka unexpectedly.
Nicholas, taken by surprise, was grinding at
mathematics very gloomily. I had never seen him so
despondent, so melancholy. He looked at me very
sadly when I sat down beside him and began to chat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why are you going to leave me?” he asked. I
had told him that I should not remain in Moscow beyond
Easter, and we were then in Lent. “Why will
you not wait till June and then we can go to Lisitchansk
together; and we will walk to the Caucasus, or we will
walk across Europe to Calais and get back to England?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor boy! There was no answer that would please
him. Moscow had no attraction for me once the snow
was off the ground and the country lay open, tempting
me. Moscow was too comfortable a place; but that
I had not English friends it was as comfortable as
London, and I was—“full of malice against the seductions
of dependency.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst I was sitting talking to Nicholas I noticed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>that the mirror in the room had been covered over with
newspapers, and I wondered why.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why is the mirror covered up?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nicholas looked at it absent-mindedly, and then
blushed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I was walking up and down and didn’t want
to see myself,” he replied. “Every time I got up to
that wall I saw my silly face till I got quite angry and
covered it up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I comforted him.</p>

<p class='c013'>He cheered up, but when I said I was going out
again he put on his things to come with me, and implored
me not to leave him all day or he might commit
suicide. “What shall we do then?” I asked. “Let’s
go down to the Mushroom Fair on the quayside; but
first we’ll have some lunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The pious Russian eats no meat in Lent. Once the
Carnival, with its burst of drinking and feasting, is
over, the Day of Forgiveness past (a sort of Old Year’s
Night festival), and Ash Wednesday has signalised itself
by a day-long tolling of bells for prayers, the true Slav
enters upon a time of rigorous self-denial. Nominally
he lives wholly upon Lenten oil; in actual practice he
generally manages to find something more sustaining—different
sorts of porridge, fruit jellies, mushroom
soups and the like. Nicholas and I went into a students’
eating-house, and neither of us were in the least
orthodox in the matter of food. I judged that my companion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>would be benefited by a large plate of roast
beef and gherkins and baked potatoes, and this we
accordingly sat down to.</p>

<p class='c013'>Vegetables are expensive in Moscow at this season
of the year—an ordinary vegetarian restaurant dinner
costs three or four shillings—and there is, therefore, a
first-rate market for any of the past summer or autumn’s
produce that the peasant can bring in. About mid-March
the Moscow peasants’ Mushroom Fair takes
place, and there is a grand turnover of greasy roubles
and copecks at that busy market. The country peasant
has awakened from his winter sleep to go on his first
adventure and work of the year, for as yet his fields are
deep in snow and Jack Frost will not be vanquished
for another month. The mushrooms that, with the
help of his wife and children, he gathered in the autumn
are all frozen together in the casks at the back of his
izba; the planks and boards of his sledge, van and
market stall lie frozen together among the drifts and
icicles. A rough jaunt this year! March came in with
great winds and snowstorms. The track of the road is
an even wilderness of snow. Yet for the fifty or even one
hundred miles that the peasant comes to this honey fair
he finds his road, and battles gaily forward. Through
drift, over stream, skirting the great forest, he goes
on with many a slip and tumble, the dry snow blowing
up and down in a Russian snow mist. Wrapped up in
sacking and sheepskin, he sits among his casks and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>trestles, sings or sleeps or talks to his horse, every now
and then standing up and pulling the horse round by
his rope reins with a “Gently, Vaska,” or “Curse you,
Herod.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the first week in Lent he arrives at Moscow,
and every year at that time one may see the long line
of stalls and booths newly rigged up on the quayside
of the river, below the Kremlin walls. This year it has
snowed heavily every day, and the wind had blown the
stalls about and drifted the snow over the merchandise.
It was snowing when Nicholas and I arrived, and the
large flakes were settling on the honey and the oil and
the mushrooms, and dissolving as we watched them.
We kicked our way through the deep snow on the uneven
ground, with a merry crowd laughing and chaffering.
The Moscow old-wife was very busy. She is a
fat, rank, jolly woman, more like the old-wives of
Berwick than those of any other place in Europe, perhaps.
Figure the old gossips buying, gingerly sampling
and tasting, dipping in a huge vat of soaking mushrooms
and taking a Rabelaisian mouthful from a great wooden
spoon, or holding a dripping yellow-green mushroom
between a fat thumb and fore-finger. There were also
women in charge of some of the stalls—peasant wives,
fat, laughing, healthy women. The wind blew fresh
against the rosy cheeks of a gay crowd, for the market
was truly half a revel and a game. It was a fair, but
quite a strange one. What an array of clumsy casks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>all these full of very mushy-looking mushrooms soaking
in oil or vinegar. Then there were ropes of dried mushrooms,
tied as we tie daisy-chains in England. But it
is not only a Mushroom Fair. At the corner by the
bridge there was a huge pile of bright red berries; the
peasant in charge insisted on calling me Prince. The
scene remains quite vivid in my memory. These were
cranberries; they can be stewed into a fine-looking
pudding. <i>Kisel</i>: sour jelly, they call it; it is bright
crimson and looks too good to eat. Boys were running
about with stuffed birds—crows, magpies, jays—that
the country youths stuffed in the autumn. One could
buy all sorts of things, even inlaid chess-tables and
hand-made chess-men. At one side a youth was selling
calico that had been in a fire; there was a crowd
about him and a Petticoat-Lane-like-bidding going on.
Next to him was a place for buying plaster saints and
holy pictures. The next stall was occupied by a man
with hot pies—piping hot yellow puffs full of mushroom
and cauliflower—and, <i>vis-à-vis</i>, a huge steaming samovar
from which a thirsty throng were getting tea at 1d.
a glass. Perhaps the most Russian sight was the huge
piles of clumsy wooden implements hacked out of pine
with the all-useful adze. A sea of Russian basins, of
chests, trays, and all kinds of boxes. Then there was
the pottery department, a fine place for buying queer
pots. If you wished to buy mushrooms in oil you had
first to go and buy a pot; you obtained a strange brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>vase, looking like a Roman urn. You wanted to buy
jam—you must first buy a pot. A stall over the way
is heaped up with honey—hard, frozen honey. We
were invited to buy. “Only fivepence a pound,” said
the man. We bought half a pound and received it in a
piece of newspaper, a sheet of the <i>Novoe Vremya</i>. Most
of the customers of the fair bought green rush baskets
for a few pence, and in these put dried mushrooms,
dried fruits for compôte, cranberries and the like. The
vendor of the honey had driven in from Toula, a town
in the vicinity of Tolstoy’s estate. I thought I might
get some first-hand information about the great novelist,
so I asked:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How is Tolstoy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know. Who is he? Is he a wrestler?” he
replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently the prophet was not unknown but in his
own country.</p>

<p class='c013'>This fair is a great chance to see the Russian peasant
with his own produce. Visitors to Moscow in Lent are
seldom shown this really interesting sight, much more
humanly interesting than the Kremlin, the churches
and museums. For Russia can boast of very little
antiquity in her civilisation or her buildings. Much
more interesting than her little past is her present.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the fair all is Russian—even the oranges and
lemons come from the groves of South Russia and the
Caucasus. One gets another glimpse of the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>harmony, the harmony of which the winter, the forests,
the church, the peasants, the beggars are integral parts.
This Russian life is actually organic, and all that is of it
is necessarily akin to all. This picture is undiscordant.
Happy, rude, contented Russia! All these old-world
folk are like grown-up children playing shop with mudpies.
What careless laughter rings about this snowy
fair; what absurd wit and earthly humour! Crowds
of jokes are about—mostly of the low Chaucerian
kind. Indeed, one cannot help asking how much this
fair has changed since the fourteenth century. Nature
has turned out mushrooms, cranberries, crab-apples,
oranges, honey, Russian men and women in just about
the same cast as she does to-day—and probably even
the hand-made chess-men differed little from these on
sale now. The world does not change very much.</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />DEPARTURE FROM MOSCOW</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'>ALL the winter I had been in correspondence
with Kharkov in connection with my lost
luggage. Early in April I received a notification
that the box had been found.
The Customs House then sent me in a bill of charges, so
much for every day the box had remained in their possession.
The railway and Customs made two pounds
profit out of the loss of my box; they actually charged
me for the loss! So slowly, moreover, did the business
go forward that it seemed to me I should not recover my
property before I left Moscow. Even after they received
the money they seemed in no hurry to proceed.
But one day I did actually go out to a goods station and
get my box into a sledge and take it home. The end
was sudden, so sudden that I could not help laughing at
the contrast. A carter took me down into a dark
cellar to identify the box, and the said box, high up
among large packing-cases, was identified. In its transit
from that high position to <i>terra firma</i> it managed to displace
a quarter of a ton case, which came down with a
crash like thunder. We were both knocked down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and both very badly bruised, though I think the carter
came off second best; a stream of blood was pouring
down his face. “Oh, Lord God!” I heard him exclaim.
He was looking at the Ikon in the room; it
sounded as if he was swearing at it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Any limbs broken?” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, praise the Lord! There’s your box.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Two days after this there was an immense thaw and
the sledges gave way to wheeled carriages. On the
Wednesday it had been a white city; on Thursday it
was black and there was not a sledge to be seen. The
sun had been getting hotter and winning its way each
day, just a little, against the snow, and then suddenly
one night a west wind swept in from Europe and the
Atlantic, and with it a flood of rain. Winter was
drowned. No one was sorry; for winter by all accounts
had stayed too long. The Sunday was Palm Sunday,
the day of branches. The Russians call it <i>Verba</i>, and it
is a great festival in Moscow. Shura and Nicholas and
I went to the Kremlin to enjoy the sights.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a day of ecstasy. The sun shone as it had not
done since I came to Moscow. It was suddenly full of
promise, and one felt the promise in one’s blood. One’s
fingers tingled with the desire to live, the eyes rested
with envy upon the green branches that the people
carried. In the Kremlin there was a din as of a carnival.
Ten thousand silly squeakers and hooters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>sounded in the air. Inflated pigs were expiring, ridiculous
sausages were deflating and collapsing, toy geese
were quacking, boys and girls were blowing whistles and
trumpets, and students also were blowing, and even
staid old gentlemen. This day commemorated the
triumphal entry into Jerusalem; it was also the triumphal
entry of spring into Moscow, of life into death.
The crowd huzzaing was delirious with the news that
the winter was over. Even the rich people in their
carriages, passing in solemn state into the Kremlin,
seemed part of the new life. They were all in spring
dresses—the women in purples and soft greens, and
the men in light tweeds.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seemed to me, however, that those on foot were
having the gayer time. We were crushed as tightly
as I have ever been in a London crowd. Everyone was
laughing and chaffing, especially the girl students from
the University, and the confetti was flying thick and
fast.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Verba</i> week was my last in Moscow. On Easter
Sunday I left for the South.</p>

<p class='c013'>Easter Eve came at last, the greatest night in the
Russian holy year. At midnight we were all in the
Kremlin, that is, I was there, and Nicholas and Shura,
and everyone else in Moscow surely. Phrosia, the
servant whom I had accompanied to the shrine at
Sergievo, had taken a large sweet Easter loaf and a cake
of sugar-cream, <i>paskha</i>, to be consecrated at church.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>I saw her in a yard outside the little monastery in the
Petrovka. There were two or three hundred cakes
waiting with hers, all set out on informal tables on
trestles. In the centre of each cake a wax candle was
burning. Each table was a little forest of candles, some
long, some short, some just lit, and some burning out.
Every now and then a priest came and took a cake into
the church just as the candle was expiring. Phrosia had
evidently just come, for the candle on her <i>pashka</i> was
newly lit. The church was a casket, a precious case of
gems. The priests moving to and fro, the pale faces
of the Ikons lit up by many candles seemed the glamour
of a fairy tale. The cakes being brought in, the priest
sprinkling holy water, seemed rites which I, a mortal,
only saw by accident. Indeed, any Englishman would
have found Easter Night strange and wonderful. It is
one of the two occasions in the year when one can see
again what is below the surface of Moscow life of to-day.
One can see what Moscow was before it became so commercialised.
At six o’clock on Easter Eve the electric
trams cease to run; from that moment Moscow becomes
the holy city of old time. The strange mystery and
sacredness which must have enwrapped it in ancient
days is again felt in the streets. The shops are all shut
and dark, the churches are all open and bright. The
thousand-and-one street temples are decorated with
coloured lamps, the doors stand wide open, the sacred
faces of the Ikons look out into the roads. Even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>air is infected with church odours, and the multitudinous
domes of purple and gold rest above the houses
in enigmatical solemnity—they might be tents and
pavilions of spirits from another world.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the streets men and women are carrying lighted
candles hither and thither, and every now and then
one sees a person carrying his <i>paskha</i> cake to church.
Outside the Cathedral of the Annunciation a regiment
of guards is drawn up and an officer is giving them
instructions as to the duties for the night. Presently
the rich and aristocratic families of Moscow will drive up
one by one to do homage to the Ikons in the cathedral.
At midnight the Kremlin is so thronged that it is difficult
to move. All are waiting for the <i>Resurrection</i>, all
are waiting for the booming forth of the great bell of
St John’s Church, the largest bell of Moscow and of
Russia, rung only once a year. That will signify that
“Christ has risen.” The priests are praying before
the Ikons and searching their hearts. Shortly after
midnight they will rise from their knees and announce
to the people, “We have found him. He is risen.
<i>Christos Voskrece.</i>”</p>

<p class='c013'>I wandered among the merry crowds to the tower
of St John’s, and as I was passing the great cannon, the
Tsar of cannons, I overheard someone speaking English.
I directed my steps in that direction and found the
people, two clean-shaven young men, in English
clothes, high English collars and bowler hats—immaculately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>English. They were talking loudly, evidently
taking it for granted that no one could understand
them. I took up my stand quite close and listened.
This is what I overheard. It was very small talk,
but it sounded very strange to hear it in this Russian
crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Moscow people are very rough, they’ve no
manners at all. They don’t care who they jostle or push
as long as they get along.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I was going through one of the Kremlin
gates yesterday and a fellow knocked my hat off. Of
course it was very nice of him, but he didn’t stop to tell
me why he did it. I thought he was mad, but they told
me afterwards it was a sacred gate. I saw several
people take off their hats as they went through. They
say the sentry has orders to fire on anyone who does
not lift his hat. I felt I wanted to apologise to someone.
It’s a beautiful custom, and I hadn’t any intention of
infringing the law. I believe in doing as Rome does in
Rome. I wonder if the sentry would shoot. Nice row
there’d be if they shot a British subject.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re right, but what’d they care. They’re a
rotten lot. I’d like to pole-axe the Governor. By-the-bye,
have you heard anything of White recently? He
said he thought his firm was sending him out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you know him at all? He was a thorough
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“No, not much; he didn’t live my way, you know.
I met him several times down the county ground.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, he was fairly mad over Surrey, wasn’t he?
We played many games together, he and I; he bowled
an awfully tricky ball, a gentle lob-dob, nearly full pitch.
You thought you were going to put it out of the ground
for six, and then suddenly you found your wicket down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this point a disreputable beggar interrupted them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What d’you make of him—a drunken monk, eh?”
said the cricketer. Both the Englishmen put on a look
suggesting the principles of Political Economy, and
signified by a frown that they did not encourage
beggars. The “drunken monk,” however, did not
budge for five minutes, he looked up at them and
grinned. The people all round grinned also and turned
to watch the scene. Then, suddenly, the beggar, after
churning his mouth for some time, spat on the Harris
overcoat of the cricketer’s companion and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c013'>“German pigs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beast,” said the Englishman, looking at his coat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They ought to be coming out soon. It’s only a
short procession, they say—out of the church round
the wall and back again; then the bells will begin.
It’s after midnight now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I moved away at this point and left the cricketer
putting his watch to his ear to see if it was going. I had
promised to meet Shura and Nicholas and go up into
the steeple with them. I found them on one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>stone galleries where the little bells of the church nestle
together. They had a collection of squibs and crackers
and coloured lights which they were letting off so as
to allow girl students below to pretend to be terrified.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The priests have come out,” said Nicholas, all at
once pointing to a little procession just proceeding from
the Uspensky. “<i>Christos Voskrece, Christos Voskrece</i>,”
we heard all around us, and everyone was kissing one
another. Then all the little bells of the churches began
to tinkle, first a few and then more and more in confused
ecstatic jangling. Moscow bells do not sound in
the least like English bells, the chime is not musical or
solemn. Our bells chant, their bells cheer. On Easter
Night it is ten thousand bells, the voice of a thousand
churches praising God. A wild, astonishing clamour,
and then suddenly came one sound greater in itself than
all the little sounds put together, the appalling boom of
the great bell of St John Veleeky:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ting a ling, ling, ling, ling,</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Suddenly Katia passed me—the girl I took to the
theatre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>Christos Voskrece</i>,” said I, “Christ is risen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” said she, “He is risen,” and threw a handful
of confetti in my eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>We all ate <i>paskha</i> cake together in the Kislovka
room at three in the morning, and drank students’

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />THE COMING OF SUMMER IN THE CAUCASUS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'>ANYTHING more wonderful than the change
from winter to summer on the Caucasian
mountain slopes could not easily be
imagined. In April the plains were deep
in snow, and in May, when English woods were leafing,
every tree and bush looked stark and bare. Only by an
occasional sallow in bloom one knew that the winter
was over. The snowdrops and blue-bells sprang up in
winter’s traces, and then verdure danced out and clothed
valley and slope up even to the summit of some low
hills. The English spring, as I imagined it, was months
ahead, but dawdled on among the cold winds; this hot
summer overtook it at a bound and rushed on to its
later glories, to the blossoming and fruiting of vine and
pomegranate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the wonderful things that happened in May it is
difficult to write calmly. The fairies did not linger;
they came trippingly, they waved their wands, they
ran. The spells of green and gold were wrought, and
charm moved over the land. The cowslip appeared,
budded, blossomed, faded—in one short week. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>quick step the dainty lilies of the valley came and took
their place, and for three days glistened among grasses
and ferns upon the rocks; and slender, graceful Solomon
Seals stooped lovingly toward their sister lilies. Then
hillsides suddenly blazed with yellow rhododendrons.
Honeysuckle bloom came nestling in sunny corners
among the rocks, then tall, sweet-scented bog-bean;
ten varieties of orchis I found, and wild rose, wild strawberry
and raspberry, wild vine, wild walnut, peach and
pear and plum. In the grassy places, just dry after the
last melted snow, out came the lizards, so that the plain
literally squirmed with them, cunning, vicious little
lizards basking in the sun, small and brown in May, but
fat and green and speckled later, kissing at one another
like snakes, and fond of biting off one another’s tails.
In the May sun the adder shot off from his damp sun-bath
as one crushed through the scrub. The trees burst
into leaf, first in the valleys and then on the hills. Each
day one watched the climbing green and saw the fearful
dark brow of a mountain soften away and pass from
deep impenetrable black to soft laughing green. Snowy
peaks lost their glory of white, and one knew them to be
but little grey Grampians beside the huge mountains of
Elbruz. The road-mud hardened and Persian stone-breakers
were busy smashing their little heaps of
boulders; in a week they had gone and the piles of rocks
had become neat little heaps of flints. Then came
terrific storms, a thunder-burst each week, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>rivers rose in their shingle beds and flooded off towards
the Caspian and the Black Sea, carrying all manner of
<i>débris</i> of uprooted shrub and tumbled rock. One soon
saw the uses of the flints: they solidified the road.
But, indeed, one day’s sun sufficed to dry up a night’s
flood. The wild winds soon blew up the Sirocco—such
dust storms that the whole landscape was for hours lost
to the eyes. What of that—that was a day’s unpleasantness
to be covered by ample compensations.
The sun was strengthening and its magic was awakening
newer, richer colours than the English eye can care for,
was working in strange new ways upon the soul
mysteries and body mysteries of men and women. One
knew oneself in the South, in the land of knives and
songs. Every man seemed on horseback. The Georgian
chiefs and the Ossetines and Cherkesses came careering
along the military roads, their cartridge vests flashing,
daggers gleaming. The <i>abreks</i> and <i>sheikhs</i> sprang down
from the hills, appalling the lesser traffickers of the road,
pilgrim, merchant, tramp, by their show of arms and
bizarre effrontery. The strange hill shepherds, looking
like antique Old-Testament characters, came marching
before and behind their multitudinous flocks, with their
four wolfish sheep-dogs in attendance and their camping
waggons behind; from the mountain fastnesses they
came, their faces one great flush of shining red, their
eyes bathed in perspiration, blazing with light, their
lank hair glistening. Often I lay beside the stream in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the Dariel Gorge and watched flocks of a thousand or
fifteen hundred sheep and goats pass by me. The lively
mountain lambs, brown and black and white, very
daring or short-sighted, would plunge three or four at a
time into the stream beside me, would come up and stare
in my face and bleat and then run away. Then the
under-shepherds, who hold long poles and keep the
marching order, would rush up and hurry them away
from the water to the road, the procession of dust and
woolly backs would slowly pass away to the music of
the incessant calling of ewe and lamb.</p>

<p>A GROUP OF CAUCASIAN SHEPHERDS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The flocks are marched to the market towns, and big
deals in hundreds and thousands of head of sheep are
made. Or the shepherds encamp outside the town
and send batches of sheep to be hawked through the
streets. The Persian butchers come out and bid for
their mutton. Boys run about the herd feeling the
flesh of the sheep, masters weigh them in their arms or
compare weights by holding a sheep in each hand.
Each butcher takes one or two, or three or four, as he
feels he is making a bargain or otherwise. One must
not forget the twenty minutes’ parley over prices. At
last the business gets accomplished, and the flock goes
on down the street to other butchers and leaves its
little doomed contingent at each stall. On one occasion
when I was watching, a lamb refused to be separated
from a purchased brother, and, despite all efforts of the
butcher and shepherd, came bleating back to the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>who were bought. The hillman hawker and the townsman
exchanged some witticism, and then the former
struck a bargain and gave the affectionate lamb in cheap.
I know the man’s stall and once or twice have bought
mutton there. The butcher does not slaughter all his
sheep at once. First one goes and then another. One
dead sheep or a part of one always hangs in his shop.
All parts of the animal are sold at the same price, fourpence
a pound, and customers do not, as a rule, specify
leg or breast or neck, but simply the quantity they require.
When the butcher buys four sheep he kills one
and hangs it in his shop, and the other three live ones
are under the counter eating fodder or playing about
among the customers’ legs. The sheep-hawker makes
his tour of the town and is all day at it, tramp, tramp,
tramp, through mud or dust. In the evening one may
see the muddied remnant of the flock, the rejected, the
unsold, being driven wearily back to the main flock on
the plains. Very melancholy the little party looks, and
it is difficult to think them the fortunate ones, so woebegone
and wretched do they appear. All movement
forward is a labour to them; not a few are lame, others
have succumbed, and sometimes one sees the hawker
with a dead lamb on his shoulder. No dogs are in
attendance; none are needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is plenty of money going in the town, plenty of
wine and all good things for the up-country man when
he cares to come in. With relief the house-heating is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>given up in April. Life becomes lighter, winter things
are put away, windows are taken out, the summer wind
begins to blow through all dwellings. The white-clad
townsman takes his ice at his ease in the fresh air on the
boulevards. The full, fat peasant eats as much as he
can of pink and white and yellow for two copecks, and
standing beside the ice-cream barrel, smacking his lips,
testifies his appreciation by voluble remarks to passers-by.
The Persian gunsmith sits in his open booth and
inlays precious daggers, setting the handles with little
constellations of stars. In glass cases, beside his shop,
Caucasian belts and scimitars sparkle in the sun. There
are streets of these workers where one might feel the sun
was being robbed of his rays. One is in the land of the
“Arabian Nights,” from which nightmare and opium
have been taken away. There is a gentleness, an ease
and brightness not to be found in Little Russia or
Moscow. Somewhat typical of this and wonderful in its
way is the march of Russian regiments, the easy, swinging
march, not quick, no, rather slow even, but pleasant
and easy as for long distances. It was pleasant to regard
a detachment of these marching so, their leaders
singing a solo of a national hymn, the rest taking up the
chorus. Pleasant also to listen to the singing of the
workmen operating with the hand-crane at the riverside.
There seemed to be general happiness and content
among men as among animals. The sun bade love
and life come from turf and rock and tree and man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>from man none the less than from the rest there came
the answer unspoilt by self-sight and introspection.
In scarlet and purple and blue came the answer. One
saw all the truth as one looked at dark Georgian
maidens trooping along a vineyard in May. To these
this sun gave promise of a wine harvest.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c015'>MY kit for the Caucasus was composed of
the following:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>A waterproof sleeping-sack,</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span class='small'>A pair of Georgian boots,</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span class='small'>A revolver,</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>and a trunk full of miscellaneous clothes. The books
and papers of my recovered box I lent out to Moscow
acquaintances or posted to England. My plan for the
summer was to find an izba in the depths of the mountains
and make a home there. On reaching Vladikavkaz
Station I would put my luggage in the cloak-room and
set out right away to tramp the mountains until I
found what I wanted. Then I would return to Vladikavkaz
and fetch my luggage in a cart.</p>
<p class='c013'>Nicholas professed to be very much alarmed for my
safety. He thought the place good, but he foresaw
misadventures. He himself had been in Tiflis and
Chiatouri in 1906 and had seen robbery and murder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>committed in broad daylight. He talked cut-throats
for several days, and brought a number of students to
back him up; he even urged that I take a trip down the
Volga instead. But when he saw finally that I was not
to be dissuaded, he promised to give me a letter of protection.
He would write a letter to the Priests of the
Caucasus. At each village I came to I should inquire
where the <i>pope</i> lived and go to him at once and present
my letter. I agreed: no doubt the priest in a village
would know where there was an empty izba to be found,
and he would help me to get it at a fair rate. So
Nicholas wrote the following epistle:—</p>

<p class='c020'>“<i><span class='sc'>Dear Little Father</span>,—Knowing that all our southern
clergy are holily bound to give hospitality and help to
fellowmen, I have taken upon myself the liberty—under
unusual circumstances—to recommend to your care my
friend, the Englishman Graham, who brings you this
letter. I have taken, I repeat, the liberty upon myself to
recommend him to your tenderness and care. He is an
important man. I trust you will help him in his life in
any way that stands within your power, that you will advise
him in difficulty or introduce him to priests who can
advise him. He may be often in danger among mountain
people, and may have you only for a refuge. Money will
not be necessary to him—only advice. As you are kind
to him, may the Lord God be good to you and the holy work
will be advanced, for Mr Graham is a writer who much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>loves Russia, is a great Christian, and writes many things
about Russia and Russian things.—In confidence, I thank
you,</i></p>
<div class='c024'><i>N—— L——.”</i></div>

<p class='c017'>Vladikavkaz is a town of forty thousand inhabitants,
and is situated about two hundred miles from the Black
Sea on the west, and from the Caspian on the east.
It has been called the key of the Caucasus; it is certainly
the most convenient town from which to enter. The
English tourist, when he gets there, will be surprised to
find it a European city with handsome buildings and
shops, with a “Grand Hotel” and “Hotel Imperial”
furnished as any other establishment of such name.
There is a good service of electric trams and an abundance
of two-horse cabs; very occasionally one may see
a motor-car there. The people are, for the most part,
Russians and Georgians, though there are great numbers
of Ossetines, Tatars, Persians and Ingooshi. It is very
interesting to watch the crowds of promenaders on the
Alexandrovsky Boulevard on a festival; one sees men
and women of almost every nationality under the
Russian flag.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Georgians, famous for their beauty, are the
greatest dandies in the world. The young men, dressed
in handsome and high-coloured tunics, well armed,
show such extraordinarily slender and constricted
waists that one is tempted to think they wear corsets.
The leather belt round the middle of a young Georgian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>is strapped so tightly that he cannot use his legs freely.
He walks in a jerky little swagger, swaying his shoulders
ever so slightly from one side to another, and holding
his head high. Then the Georgian and Ossetine girls
are dark and arch; they are of large proportions and
might not be thought attractive by English people.
Their hair generally hangs down their backs in plaits,
but is screened from view by coloured veils. They
laugh and talk with ordinary freedom on the streets,
and it never struck me that they lived very retired lives,
as is reputed. In Vladikavkaz and in the Caucasus,
however, the outsider sees little sign of love-making in
the street. It is very exceptional to see a young couple,
and as for kissing in public, I should say it must be the
height of indelicacy—judging from the rarity of such a
sight. I read in a modern English book that if a
Georgian husband or wife were unfaithful, the offender
and the corespondent were exposed naked to the public
gaze. If it is true it must afford an exciting spectacle.
Apparently no divorce cases came on this summer.</p>

<p class='c013'>The traveller can obtain very good lodging at
Vladikavkaz, and French and German is spoken at the
hotels. I stayed some days in a hotel which I found
most comfortable. The nights as yet were probably
cold for sleeping out, and I doubted the possibility of
getting safely housed in mountain villages. For some
time I made daily expeditions over the Steppes, tasting
the new air and bringing back bouquets of spring flowers.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Yet at length one morning at the end of April I
slung my travelling-bed across my back and set out to
explore.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are only two regular roads over the Caucasus,
and although both start near Vladikavkaz I took
neither of them. One goes to Tiflis and the other to
Kutais. The former is the well-known Georgian
Military Road, the other is a very ill-made, broken
track, ascending to an elevation of 9000 feet, and impassable
many months of the year.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>VLADIKAVKAZ AND DISTRICT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A brawling river flows past the town from the mountains,
the Terek. It is an impetuous, shallow stream
that one could almost jump across at some seasons of
the year, but having a bed a hundred yards wide.
Looking into the valley from the mountains one sees a
vast field of grey stones and boulders; and the river,
meandering along it, gleams like a silver chain. Sometimes,
however, after a few very hot days in July, it
rises in flood and covers the whole bed, and washes away
bridges and cottages and cattle. The hotter the weather
the deeper the water; in June or July it is impossible
to ford it, even on a strong horse. It follows that
in midwinter it is shallowest and clearest. The
Georgian road has been constructed on one side, and
there have been several occasions when it has been
flooded. There is a number of villages in the valley;
it is convenient to be near water. They are inhabited
by mountain people, Georgians, Ossetines, Ingooshi. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>is strange that villages on opposite banks are near
neighbours in the winter, but are cut off from mutual
intercourse in the summer. Fortoug, for instance, is
half a mile distant from Maximkina in January, but is
thirty miles away in June, and both villages are inhabited
by the same tribe—Ingooshi. I took the cart
track that leads to Fortoug, and thought to be able to
cross over to the opposite village. I found out my mistake
later on. Mistakes, however, were not going to
disturb me. I had no destination. It didn’t matter
what happened or how far I strayed. The Caucasus
was my host; I left him the arrangements. The mountains
provided the entertainment, and I would not
doubt their hospitality and generosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>I passed through meadows; they were purple with
a little flower which grew in clusters, a labiate, common
in England, but incomparably brighter there than here.
Early purple orchis was just blossoming, and crimson
iris and fig-wort and crane’s-bill. In one deep tangled
ditch where thistles, barberry, teasle, hollyhock and
mallow struggled with nettles and convolvulus, one
read the promises for July and August. Nature stood
there like a host with drawn bows; in a moment ten
thousand arrows would have sped into the air. The
orchis and the crane’s-bill were heralds. Even the
butterflies on the wing were forerunners—tattered old
brimstones and tortoiseshells that had lived through the
winter, only to wake up in the spring and lay their eggs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and prepare the way for their children. And among
the birds it was nesting-time; as I climbed a grassy
slope I suddenly disturbed a lark, and just at my feet
found the little nest with the familiar little cluster of
dark eggs.</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />A MOUNTAIN DAWN</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;HAD turned aside from the track to climb
the side of a wooded hill near the Stolovy
Mountain; I had an idea that I might find a
sheltered spot among the trees. I had not slept
out before, and I feared to be found sleeping by any of
the natives. I was not a rich prey for the robber, but
in Russia they steal even one’s clothes. There are
many stories current in Vladikavkaz which must have
a certain amount of foundation in truth. According
to a loquacious cabman I listened to in Vladikavkaz, a
coach was stopped one day on the Georgian road,
twelve miles outside the town. It contained a pleasure
party, a number of ladies and gentlemen out to spend
the day, and they were all despoiled of their clothing.
The robbers covered them with guns and called on them
to undress and throw all their possessions in a heap on
the road or be shot. And they accordingly returned to
the town in Adam’s raiment.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had one moment of thrills this day. I had just
emerged from a wood on to a grassy ridge of the mountain,
when I saw a shepherd’s camping-ground guarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>by dogs. The dogs saw me at the same moment, and
all four came tearing along towards me. They were
something between bull-dogs and mastiffs, and I had a
good mind to climb a tree at once. But something
restrained me; the dogs were perhaps too close; I had
a cudgel in my hand, I grasped it firmly and awaited
the onslaught. Every dog’s eye was riveted on my
stick, and they all slackened speed suddenly and skirmished
to bite at my heels or dart under my arm.
They failed and slunk off; they were only uncivilised
collies after all. I was relieved. Many a man in my
position might have fired a revolver and then the owners
of the dogs would have declared war. I recalled the
words of Freshfield, the mountaineer, concerning such
positions: “It is judicious to avoid petty wrangles
with Ossetes and to tranquillise their sheep-dogs with
ice-axes rather than to dismiss them with firearms.”
A shepherd came up to me in a few minutes and began
the common series of interrogations—Where do you
come from? Where are you going to? Why? What
are you—a Russian? I answered him very vaguely
that I was going to Dalin-Dalin, a little village near by,
on business, and that I was not a Russian. “You
ought to be afraid to go in these parts,” said he, “many
men get killed; a mate of mine was murdered near here
last month.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I heard him with a little thrill, but did not alter my
plans. I found a bush, and just after sunset, when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>gnats sang in their mournful choirs, I made my bed. I
was soon deep snuggled in my waterproof sleeping-sack—my
dear old friend—night sharer of so many vicissitudes
and slumbers. A wisp of <i>crêpe de chine</i> about my
head, I feared not the meanest of all foes, the mosquitoes
that range two to each hair on the hand. I know
what happened as the darkness deepened: the birds
slunk to sleep in the bushes, all save the night-jars and
the owls that gurgled and hooted among the pines and
maples. The dark moths flitted to and fro in the first
breathless darkness of the summer night, the large red
ants carried off on their backs the dead gnats that had
perished at my hands at supper-time. Then the pale
full moon arose out of a depth of soft white cloud—passionless,
perfect. Still the owls hooted as I fell
asleep. The night passed. Morning came and I
arose gaily. Nought of what the hillman suggested
had come to pass; only once I had started, and that at
the touch of the wet snout of an inquisitive hedgehog.
I remember now how piggy scuttled off. But two
minutes after that I was sleeping again. There had
been one other event of the night. About two hours
before dawn the rain came softly down. A broad cloud
had gently breasted this little mountain upon which I
was encamped. It rained steadily and much. I curled
myself more completely within my sack and let it rain.
In the little moments when I did not sleep I heard the
drops falling on the cover above me. Had any wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>robber come upon this strange bundle under the bush
his woodlore must have told him it was no beast or bird
ever seen upon the hills or under the sky. I think he
would have crossed himself and passed by.</p>

<p class='c013'>So passed my first night of my tramp in the mountains,
quite a unique night, soft, strange, wonderful.
I felt I had begun a new life. I had entered into a new
world and come into communion with Nature in a way
as yet unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rain had stopped as the first light came up into
the sky. I arose gaily, pleasantly cool and fit after the
sleep and the rain. By the faint light I saw the valley
below me, and the grand grey rocks on the other side.
I looked up to the summit of my own mountain, and as
I munched a remainder of dry bread felt all the unspeakable
delight of an awakening with the birds after
having spent the night with the mountains. But,
indeed, I had awakened before the birds, and as yet the
mountains slept, the long grey line of bearded warriors,
calm, majestic, unmoved, invincible. Nature in
reverence lay hushed beneath them, waiting for a
signal. I passed carefully over the wet grasses—softly,
secretly, as if everywhere children slept.</p>

<p class='c013'>Clamber, clamber, clamber, up then to the highest
point. At last I stood there with the dew on my heels.
All the east lay before me, and such a horizon as one
can only see when looking from the northern spurs of
the Caucasus. The sun had not risen, and from north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to south lay an illimitable length of deep blood red,
blood without life, red without light—dead, fearful,
unfathomable red. I stood as one convicted, as a too-daring
one, awe-stricken. From the place where I had
slept I had not dreamed of this; no tinge on the morning
twilight had suggested what the obstacle of the peak
withheld. I felt pale and grey as a morning mist, insubstantial
as a shadow. The grasses trembled wet
at my feet. Behind me the austere mountains sat unmoved,
deep in undisturbed sleep or contemplation.
No bird sang, no beast moved, not even the wet trees
dripped. All waited for a signal, and I waited. Death
was passed—life not come. I was at the gates of the
day, but had come early....</p>

<p class='c013'>I was looking westward when the world awoke,
looking at the grey mountains. Suddenly it was as if
they blushed. Crimson appeared in a valley and ran
and spread along the cliffs and rocks and over chasms,
suffusing the whole westward scene. It was the world
blushing as the first kiss of the sun awakened it to a new
day. And as I turned, there in the west was the hero,
raising himself unaided victoriously upward. It was
the sun, the hot, glorious one, uprising, glistening, burning
out of a sea of scarlet, changing the blood into ruby
and firing every raindrop to a diamond. Most glorious
it was, seen, as it were, by one alone, and that one myself,
upon a peak adding my few feet to its five thousand
and taking also that crimson reflection, that rosette or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>favour accorded those presented at the opening of the
day. At how many town pageants had one been a
mocker, but here was ritual that stood majestic, imperious
in its meaning—only to be revered.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ceremony was at length over. The day was
opened, the freedom of the world had been given, one
had but to step down into the gardens laid open to
man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down the hill and over a moor the way led to the
little red-roofed village called Dalin-Dalin. Ten steep
downhill miles they were, and every mile waved invitingly.
Onward then downward, and with steady
steps, for the rain has left everything slippery. Wet it
is, wet, and the grasses and fern and scrub are up to the
waist, but the sun will dry both these and me, and by
noon we shall all be hot and thirsty. Through a long
wood the path goes. Last week, when I was in the
woods, the ground was golden with cowslips, but the
fairies’ pensioners are now all gone. Only the tall tiger
lilies look down like modest maidens, and brown-green-fingered
ferns hold out little monkey hands. Wet, wet—in
the boots the water squirts and squeezes. A hare
pauses in front and then bounces off—the long-legged,
easy runner. So steep and wet is the path that it is
difficult to keep one’s footing, and one has to hold on
to the branches to keep balance. Mile after mile the
distance gets accomplished, and the wood is passed.
Beyond the wood is a valley of nettles, immense docks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>waste comfrey, canterbury bells and entwined convolvulus,
such a bed of rank vegetable as only the black
virgin earth, the mountain mist and hot noonday sun
can bring forth. Through that! There is even country
ahead and less chance of snakes. Yonder the wild
rose blooms and the eglantine and snowy guelder rose.
The sun is getting hotter, and half-dazed flies wake to a
morrow they had not expected; they buzz stupidly at
one’s nose and ears—they have some stale news to impart.
It is morning again, they say.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is Dalin-Dalin. Just outside the village a dead
horse lies on the moor, and the flies fluster about it.
Was it killed in some night affray with robbers, I wonder?</p>

<p class='c013'>The mountains lie peacefully in the sunshine. The
birds sing; myriadfold humming and stirring and chirping
is in the grass. The rose bushes are daintily apparelled,
and tall spurge lifts its yellow face to look at the
beauties around. Sleeping in the copse, even in more
abundance than yesterday, are next month’s flowers:
time and the sun are softly wooing them. A few
mallow and lily and rose will have faded away and given
place to new revellers, new festivities. The morning
sun, warmer every moment, promises for to-morrow,
to-morrow week, to-morrow month, the blooming of
the poppy and the ripening of the vine.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c018'>I</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'>AT Dalin-Dalin an old crone served me with
sushky biscuits and milk. Her shop had
apparently been built to suit her own
height, for there was not room for a man to
stand up. It was an interesting little shop, and it kept
everything, from ink to mushrooms. A large notice on
the counter confronted the customer. It said, “No
Bargaining,” which was very surprising, and suggested
to my mind that the owner might have some connection
with Germans, for whoever heard of such a sordid
notice being put up in a Russian shop. A Georgian
horseman had interpreted for me, because the old
woman understood no Russian. The Georgian, who
was just such a dandy as I have described earlier, was
drinking cranberry beer at the table with me and had
bought a packet of tea. He had evidently come from a
small village where there was no shop; his horse was
tied to a post outside. He had given a six-shilling note
to change, and all the while we drank the old woman was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>hunting for coin. I looked on with some amusement,
for she had already a large Russian basin full of black,
greasy coppers. She began counting them out very
seriously. I put a question through the Georgian,
asking if she had any eggs in the shop. When it had
been repeated, she looked up for a moment and replied:
no, but she would go out and find some. And she lost
count and said something which seemed to correspond
to “Eh, deary, deary, deary, dear.” Then suddenly
her husband, an old gaffer, came in, and deposited a
little bag of three-farthing bits, about a hundred of
them. So they made up the change, all of coppers,
though the horseman expostulated, “All that black
money even a strong horse couldn’t carry!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The tribe that inhabits Dalin-Dalin is the Ingoosh,
said to be descended from Englishmen, hence their
name. An idea is current that the Crusaders used to go
to the Holy Land by the old Georgian road, which for
two thousand years has been the one recognised road
over the Caucasus. A number of English were converted
to Mahommedanism and settled in the mountains
and took Caucasian women to wife. Their
language has many words reminiscent of English, but
I think the legend rather an unlikely story. It compares
favourably with the myth that the Georgians
are descended from the Egyptian army of Sesostris,
who marched into the Caucasus and disappeared from
their native land for ever more. And both stories find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>a companion in the explanation the priests give to the
peasants that it was in the Caucasus that the Tower of
Babel was built, the Babylonian Steeple, as they call it,
and that the hundred different races and languages are
the living proof of the confusion of tongues.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just outside the village an Ingoosh chief rode up to
me. He was a fine figure. He sat erect on a black
horse; on his shoulder hung a black sheepskin cloak,
his breast was ornamented by silver-mounted cartridge
cases; at his belt of polished leather were pistol and
dagger. A scimitar in a silver sheath lay across the
shoulders of his horse and was attached to his belt by
a light chain. His brows and hair were bushy and black,
his eyes keen and domineering. He held the reins with
one hand and kept wheeling his horse about. He was
evidently in wrath and indignation; his aspect boded
terror. I spoke first and greeted him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hail!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hail! Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dalin-Dalin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are you going to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The next village.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The next village; I don’t know what it is called.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To see it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s not the truth. Besides, there is no next
village. You must go back.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Yes, all right, afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Afterwards! What do you mean? I say <i>at
once</i>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. What is your tribe? You’re not a
Russian?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A what? That’s not true.... The English
travel in flying machines.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I convinced him by showing my passport, whereupon
he was much mollified and begged me to do him the
honour of sleeping under his roof that night. I said
that if I could not get forward I would return and take
advantage of his hospitality. So we parted. I never
went back.</p>

<p>INGOOSH WOMEN, WITH WATER-JAR</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>I knew he was without authority, and that the
dapper little Russian officials in Vladikavkaz had three
times his power. Though one would say they were but
thirds of men, pitiable waste ends of men beside this
proud cavalier, yet he was more amenable to the common
law than they were. A hundred years ago would he
not have been a king and they—slaves! But the wheel
of fortune has turned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road onward was lined with the tombs of chiefs.
I had walked about three miles before I came to the
first of these; each grave was marked by a high stone,
on which was represented, in red and blue painting, the
estate of the deceased. The stones stood upright, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>they marked the graves of Mahommedans; the
tombstones of Christians lie flat on the ground. The
name and fame of the deceased was set forth in characters
resembling Georgian or Persian writing, and all
around the writing were little paintings of the different
things that marked him out as a nobleman—his swords,
daggers, pistols, his belt and scimitar. Above the
writing was shown the moon under which he died, and
the star or stars. And underneath the writing and the
martial emblems were little pictures of his domestic
belongings, of his tea-kettle and his water-jar and his
praying beads, gently and carefully drawn so that one
loved mankind for the little dearnesses there. The
painter had actually put in his goloshes and his jack-boots
and the rug he slept on. On this first tomb,
too, it was all arranged in the shape of a man; the moon
represented his head, the stars his neck, the swords his
arms, the jack-boots his feet, and the writing in the
middle his body. It seemed to me that men had tried
to gain the attention of God and had done this like
children, wishing to be taken notice of. If there is a
human God that comprehends our life He must smile
at our dear ways. Man must be very lovable to Him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I walked by many tombs and all were similarly
marked; some were larger than others, and had many
stones around for the traveller to rest upon. I took
rest at noon and ate my mid-day meal and looked upon
the scene. Near by, on a ridge, there were graves of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>another sort, a close-packed cemetery with hundreds of
stones, and on them no emblems were painted and no
names written. They were the graves of the retainers,
of the nameless many. Six miles away, on a mountain,
I saw the village of Fortoug. Thence the way wound
indolently upward along the sides of gnarled cliffs. A
thousand feet beneath lay the silver river. The scene
was one of splendour and of strange, wild beauty. For
a moment I was alone with myself. It seemed that the
wild earth that is so shy of men had taken me to herself
and had lost all her timidity. She was living as she
does when no one is looking on. Earth is more beautiful
than all women, more gentle than the timidest, more
splendid than the grandest.... A pathos of longing
came over me as if a cloud had crept into the sky; I
was solitary; why was I here? What was happening
in the other places of the world, in Moscow, in Lisitchansk,
in London, on Ludgate Hill, in my English
home? Why did man live in a scene and forget all the
other scenes that existed at the same time? Why did
I long to be conscious of the whole surface of life at
once, to be, as it were, everywhere at home at once?
The pathos of the present time is that it is breadth with
length, infinite breadth, and that our scene is only one
point on that infinite line. The Present Time is everywhere
at once. Its duration is but for an instant, a
minute, an hour, but its content is universal. It is
more instant than light shed, it covers the worlds at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>once and is existent simultaneously to the ends of space,
and it is as punctual on the furthest star as on the little
mountain road where I am sitting. The blade of grass
trembling at my feet has trembled just in time. Its
movement is contemporaneous with the present time
all over the world. The shadow which for a moment
dwells over the valley, changing the little mountain
rivulet which is tumbling down to the Terek from a
warm, flashing, inviting stream to what appears a river
of salt or ice, is the aspect of the present time made up
for me by the gnarled and frowning cliffs, the mountain
road, the heavy ox-cart upon it and the clumsy,
patient oxen beating up the dust, the ruined castle on
the mountain, with the cottages of Fortoug clinging
to it like lichen, and the clustered gravestones on the
knoll where the tribesmen lie buried, and the solitary
tombs of the chiefs. It is made up for God, the universal
eye, by—everything!</p>

<p class='c013'>At Fortoug the whole village turned out to see me,
and the old man of the place took charge of me and sat
me in his best room whilst his daughter made dinner
for me. And he had never seen an Englishman before,
had never heard of them, the Inglechani, for that was
how he translated the Russian word Anglichanin into his
language. Where did my tribe lie? He was surprised
not to have seen any of us in their valley before. I
pointed north-west, beyond Elbruz. He nodded as if
he understood, and then my meal came up—lamb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>cutlet and millet-bread—bread baked of millet-seed and
very dry. Then the old gentleman showed me photographs
of his four sons, fine fellows; they had all left
home and gone he knew not where. He begged me to
remain and rest as long as I pleased, and assured me I
could find no further road into the mountains, and that
the river was unfordable, and that I should have to
return the way I came.</p>

<p class='c013'>As I did not wish to rest or to take his advice about
the road I thought it better to pretend I would return
to Dalin-Dalin. That satisfied him. It did not occur
to him that I should make a detour and follow the river
course, path or no path.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>II</h3>

<p class='c017'>As the sun was sinking I found a resting-place soon.
I chose a pleasant grassy hollow sheltered by two
boulders. It was above the road and just beneath a
graveyard: I could see all that happened on the road
without standing the chance of being seen myself. But
in truth there was little to see, beyond an occasional
horseman and an ox-cart now and then. Each man
who came rested a little beside the tombs before going
on, for the road was a stiff climb. At sunset a party
of Mahommedans came and said their prayers, faced
Mecca, bowed to the earth, kissed it, rose and bowed
again.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Then the owls stepped out from their hiding-places
in the walls of the rocks and flew for little stretches
noiselessly, and shrieked at one another. The shadow
after sunset had begun low and now was claiming the
summits of the cliffs; presently it would rest upon the
sky itself, and night would have come. One by one the
stars appeared, and I lay in my sleeping-sack and looked
up at them. It became a perfect night, lit by a bright
moon and a myriad of clearest stars. There was a
silent breeze and a freshness on its wings; I lay full
stretched on the ground and fitted my body to the soft
earth. One could almost imagine that the dead in the
tombs all lay as I did and stared into the starry heaven:
I looked at the railed-in village of the dead above me
and down to where the large tombs lay. They did lie
as the poet wished, “under the wide and starry sky,”
and, to the dwellers in the villages, to be buried so was
ordinary. They knew of no other life or death. They
could not compare their stars with other stars, and
therefore knew not of their beauty. I had seen the
human stars lit on the Thames Embankment. It
seemed very beautiful that the hand which wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Under the wide and starry sky</div>
      <div class='line'>Dig the grave and let me lie,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>also wrote, “There are no stars like the Edinburgh gaslamps
and no atmosphere like the air of Auld Reekie.”
Again one wished to be everywhere at home. “Philosophy,”
Novalis said, “was home-sickness.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>A little procession of cloud-scuds passed over the sky
and I fell asleep. I awakened again as the dawn light
was flooding upward: the peaks of distant white summits
were rosy-red with the reflection of sunrise. Then
gradually, as the shadow had climbed upward the night
before, so the light came down—down, down into the
valley. It was as if angels were being let down by shining
rope ladders. A lark jumped from the grass beside
me, brown and wet, and twittered on a boulder and
sang three notes. It was magical.</p>

<p class='c013'>I gathered sticks and dry grass and made a fire, and
watched it burn, and boiled a kettle on it, and made tea
and munched millet-bread. I had a supply of this
“biscuit.” After tea a river dip and then onward!</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole of this day, from sunrise to sunset, I
wandered and met not one human being. Therefore
I nearly starved, for I had a very poor day’s rations in
my bag. After making my detour past Fortoug I had
to climb the steep cliff in order to proceed, for there
was no means of following the river otherwise. The
water hugged the rock and was very deep and rapid. I
crept through a wood on hands and knees, and when I
got to the other side found an impassable wall stretching
up to the snow-line. I found a cleft, however, and
a path leading away from the direction I wished to take.
I went along this. It was difficult to follow, and led up
to a perfectly barren region, where there was not a
shrub or blade of grass, or even a piece of moss to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>seen; nothing but grey rock and the waste end of last
winter’s snow, not yet melted by the summer sun. I
grew rather anxious, for I had no wish to sleep at such
a height in such cold air, but suddenly the path diverged
downward again, and late in the evening I clambered
down a dangerously steep slope right into a valley.
The boulders were very loose, and there was a chaos of
them, large and small. One had to step from one to
another all the way down, and sometimes just a touch
would send a rock bigger than myself thundering into
the valley below. At last, in the twilight of the evening,
I found myself on the Georgian road in the Gorge of
Dariel. I was some way up the gorge, just at the
Trans-Caucasian frontier. I hailed a cart coming along
and got a lift to the Kazbek village. It was quite dark
when we arrived, so I plucked out Nicholas’s epistle
from my bosom and inquired the way to the village
pope.</p>

  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />THE IKON NOT MADE BY HANDS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c015'>VLADIMIR ALEXANDROVITCH was, I
suppose, one of the minor clergy. It was
evident he was very poor; his house consisted
of one room only, and was furnished
by two chairs and a table. Several Ikons hung on the
walls. On the floor a rough black sheepskin mat
showed where he slept. He wouldn’t find me a lodging,
but bade me welcome to his own. We ate <i>kasha</i> together,
buckwheat porridge, and then he put the samovar
on and we had tea. The Ikons were all Christ-faces,
and they watched us all through the meal in a
way that gave the place a strange atmosphere. At my
elbow stood a famous picture, one that many Russians
love beyond all others as a comforter. It is called
“The Joy of all the Afflicted”; it is, of course, a portrait
of Christ painted in the features of a Russian
peasant. It means nothing to a foreigner, but somehow
it appeals to the peasant; it brings Christ very near to
him, it makes Him a fellow-man. Opposite me was
“The Ikon not made by hands,” also a peasant face,
but having an expression as cold as the other was warm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>But this one was arresting; one’s eyes continually
rested upon it and tried to discover some hidden meaning.
I asked the priest to tell me the story of it, and it
was not until the end that I discovered that it was a
version of the St Veronica legend. I don’t know now
whether he would agree with the version of his story
I should tell. But this is how it remains in my
mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fame of Jesus spread into many countries, even
before the time of His death. It came to Abyssinia
where a queen was dying. The tidings came of the
healing of the sick, the raising from the dead, tidings of
all the wonderful faith-miracles wrought in the distant
land where Jesus was teaching. The tidings were
brought to the dying queen, and as she heard a light
passed over her face. All those who stood by wondered
and hoped, for in the sudden light in the eyes of the
queen they deemed they saw the promise of new life.
The queen was silent, and looked on them, and then the
light faded away, and she said: “If I might see Him
it is possible I should live, but how could it happen that
He should come hither, so many hundred miles o’er
hill and vale and desert and sea, for the sake even of a
queen?” So she spoke and was silent, and yet was
not without hope. And those around her were sad,
and they waited for the queen to say more. But the
queen lay still and spoke no more, and with a strange
thought of comfort her feeble body and spirit slid gently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>into sleep. Sweetly and gently her eyes and soul
closed to the day, and her night eyes and soul opened
to the night. She dreamed. She dreamed, and then
even her dreaming self fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the morning she opened her eyes and remembered
that she had dreamed, and she remembered a voice in
the dream, and a face and a promise. She remembered
the strange words that had been spoken to her dreaming
self—“Andray, the painter, shall bring you the face
that shall save you from all harm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The queen bade heralds sound for Andray, the
painter. They sounded, and a painter, Andray by
name, was found, and they brought him before the
queen. Then, when he was come, and he stood before
the pale queen, she told him the purport of the dream,
and told him of the tidings of that Jesus of Galilee
whose comfort her soul craved. Andray understood
his quest—that he should paint the face—and that day,
ere the sun set, he departed on his long journey. His
long travelling commenced. Far over hill and vale
and sea and desert he journeyed to the Holy Land,
there to see the Saviour and paint the face that should
save the queen.</p>

<p class='c013'>And a high faith held the pale queen between life
and death during the intervening weeks, and a kindred
faith bore Andray through hardship and peril and the
fear of man and of beast. The commotion and stir
and rumour with regard to the Saviour grew noisier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>as Andray came nearer Palestine. At length he
arrived.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jesus was teaching among the people, living in His
heart the life of everyone He saw, living from His heart
in living veins over the whole earth. Of the queen He
knew in His heart, and of her faith, and of the painter
and his faith, and He in His own heart had the fulfilment
of each, the answer to each. And as part of that
answer, on the day on which Andray arrived, He stood
upon a slope teaching, and below Him were a thousand
people, listening, calling, reviling, praying, and the disciples
were bringing sick people to and fro at the Master’s
feet. So great was the crowd that Andray found it
impossible to get near, or he was too tired to struggle
through. So he climbed the opposite hill, that which
faced the one whereon Jesus was working, for the people
were in a valley between two hills. And from that
eminence Andray had a perfect view of the face that he
needed to paint.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the painter settled down to make his study, and he
found the face such a subject as he had never yet
imagined, such a face as was only one with his highest
dream of an ideal, one with the fleeting fancy of the
golden moment of his greatest love. Eagerly he drew—eagerly
for a moment—and then stopped in perplexity.
There was something wrong; he put aside his first
attempt and eagerly started a second. But the second
also he put aside, and started a third; and a fourth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and a fifth he started, for he found that directly
he traced a line it was wrong. The slightest feature
that he drew seemed at once a lie. For the living face
of the Teacher changed constantly, like the flash of the
sun on the waves; it was not one face only that he saw,
but a thousand faces; not a thousand faces only, but
every face, and even for a moment his own face.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jesus knew that he was there, and had marked him
where he sat at work upon the opposite hill. And now
He beckoned to him, and Andray gave up his efforts
and made his way down the slope. Then one of the
disciples found him at the edge of the crowd and brought
him to the throng, to the place where Jesus was teaching.
And when he was brought Jesus looked at him and
said, “My face may not be drawn by hands, lest in the
days to come man should say <i>this only</i> is the likeness of
Christ. There is not one face alone for all, but for each
man his own vision. There is one common knowledge
for all, <i>that</i> only the heart may know. What wouldest
thou then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would that I had the likeness that alone can save
my queen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jesus took a towel and pressed it to His face,
and then gave it to Andray. And on the towel was
imprinted a strange likeness of Christ. And all who
looked upon the picture marvelled, for there was in it
portraiture such as never painter’s hand could follow.
And Andray gazed, rapt, upon the living, breathing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>treasure that was his, and he marvelled at the depth
and plenitude of power and love that breathed from
its unfathomable calm; it seemed a myriad souls were
merged in one face. And he looked questioningly at the
thorn crown upon the head and the blood marks on the
brow, for in such guise was the face portrayed. There
was much in the picture that was as yet hidden from his
heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the face that Andray, the painter, brought
from Palestine, which restored to life the pale queen,
and which, set in the holy seat of the capital, wrought
many wonders and miracles. It is told that Andray,
though his paintings are now lost, became the most
wonderful painter, and his fame went throughout the
land; for before taking away the Ikon of Christ he had
received a blessing. At parting Jesus breathed on the
eyes of the painter, and said, “Thou couldest not find
My face for the reflection there of the soul of the common
man. Behold now, thou shalt not look upon the face
of any common man but thou shalt find My face there
also.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I liked the priest’s legend and probably read much
more in it than he intended. Indeed, he seemed mildly
surprised at my enthusiastic inquiries as to points in
the story. Shortly after he concluded the lamp burned
out, and as he had no more oil we went to bed. And I
slept very soundly, for I had had a stiff day’s walk, and
had not slept particularly well since I left Vladikavkaz.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Next day I was awakened by the sun full in my face.
It was time to go out. I left the priest fast asleep and
went out to see the Kazbek Mountain. The air was so
cold that it was necessary to run to keep warm even
though the sun shone. There was mist on the mountains
and the sun was fighting it. Far distant peaks
looked immense and elemental, like chaotic heaps
awaiting the creation of a world. And the conquering
sun was creating all things anew, and momentarily all
around me the gems of the earth were, as it were,
answering <i>adsum</i> to the morning roll-call. Hyacinth
and iris glittering with dew crept out of the wet scrub
and gleamed in the sunlight, and fritillary butterflies
came flitting down upon the blossoms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then above me rose the majestic mountain to which
in old time Prometheus, as the story goes, was bound,
Mount Caucasus, the wonder of the way. Its high-born
pinnacle of snow seemed to have riven the very sky
itself, and was all glistering white, as if catching the
radiance of another world. Mount Kazbek seemed a
god; the other mountains were men. The other
mountains were like grandfathers, hoary old men who
wanted children playing at their knees. They enticed
me. Grandfathers are very fond of their children’s
children.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c015'>THE yard cocks are at feud. There has been

war. Since first crow they have been
tumbling over one another, shedding the
red gore and eyeing one another terribly. Now, at four
of the afternoon, they both show signs of strife. Their
grand plumage is dirty, their combs soiled and ugly,
their necks gory, their eyes bloodshot and terrible.
Their wives, however, seem placid—almost indifferent.
Unhappy is the lot of rival Sultans!</p>

<p class='c013'>There are intervals between the battles, intervals of
rest and crowing. Poor Abdul Hamid sits below me

a minute “time’s up,” he goes out and challenges and

mountains, and I have given up the quest of a cottage
for this summer. I have taken two rooms here, and
although they are unfurnished they will suit my purposes.
It is on the banks of the Terek, and presently
I shall have to go to the river to fetch water for
tea.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had been wandering some days among the Georgian
villages near Kobi, when one morning I came into the
Georgian Road again and there met a Russian driving
a three-horse cart. He seemed badly in want of company,
so I consented to get in with him. We had the
following conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you pray?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean?” I replied.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Are you orthodox?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am not Russian,” I replied, “and I don’t belong
to the Russian church.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What then? You are Esthonian, eh? Or a
Tsech?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, English.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“English! Impossible! You have a moustache,
no Englishman has a moustache.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am English all the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you are a Protestant. I’m a Baptist.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we are brothers,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But how do you pray? Do you cross yourself?
We pray so.” He showed me how he
prayed, folded his hands on his stomach, and shut his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand,” I replied. “We pray like that,
but we kneel also, and some of our Protestants cross
themselves also.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked shocked but went on:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where do you live? You ought to come to our
gatherings. There are many of us here now since the
Declaration.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was referring to M. Stolypin’s Ukase of October
1908, which granted freedom to all religious sects in the
Empire. I told him I was not living anywhere in
particular, but that I had been tempted to take
a Georgian cottage at a place called Pkhelshi, which
had been offered me at ten roubles a month. My only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>doubt was of the cleanliness of the place. I was
afraid of being eaten up by insects. The Baptist was
horrified.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Afraid of insects!” said he. “Better be afraid
of getting your throat cut. No, you leave it to me;
I know where you can go. I’ll take you to our pastor,
he has a mill on the river. He is a very good man and
very humble. You go and live with him, he won’t take
more than five roubles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So I had come to the mill and put my things there,
and made it my abode for the time being. The driver
of the cart was very proud of his find, and introduced
me to the miller with not less mystery
and secrecy than he would have unwrapped a gold
nugget which he might have picked up on the
mountains. The host took me over and the other
bade me farewell; we should meet again at one of
their “gatherings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I had two rooms but no furniture. The miller
found me a table and I used a box to sit on. I bought
a mattress at a “bazaar” in Vladikavkaz, and a German
oil-stove and glasses and saucers and plates and a saucepan,
and a wooden spoon to stir my soup, and metal
spoons to eat it and sup it, and some knives and a
fork. I also bought a penny broom to sweep the
floors and some muslin to make a curtain. Setting
up house on my own account for the first time was a
matter of great excitement. In case anyone might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>like to try a similar experiment let me write here the
prices I paid:</p>

<p class='c013'>and the muslin cost 8d., and two tins for washing purposes
cost 1s. 6d. The other people were very interested
in my place, but did not seem surprised at the
deficiencies. A Russian woman promised to do my
washing, and my neighbour, a Persian, offered me water
from his samovar whenever I required it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was an interesting <i>ménage</i>, and left me free to go
out into the mountains whenever I wished. I could
leave my things behind and be perfectly sure they were
safe, and I could have a postal address. Food cost me
about four shillings a week—for the cost of living was
very low. Milk was 2d. a quart; new-laid eggs, 3d. a
dozen; butter, 10d. a pound; lamb, 4d. a pound; beef, 3d.
I lived on the fat of the land at four shillings a week, and
on very hot days I would take my saucepan out to the
ice-cream shop and get it full for sixpence, and then I
would invite Alimka, the yard urchin, and his little
sister, Fatima, to have tea with me.</p>

<p class='c013'>One day Fatima and Alimka brought me a sparrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>which they had caught. They had tied cotton to one
of its legs and had been flying it as one would a kite.
They did not understand cruelty; they thought I
should be amused. So when I took it away they were
fearfully enraged, and I offered them each a halfpenny,
and Alimka took his, but Fatima would not take it;
she would have the sparrow back, it was <i>hers</i>. She
screamed, and I thought she was going to have a fit.
“<i>Daviety</i>,” she screamed, “give it back,” and put
everything into that scream—mouth, face, head, feet,
knees, body and red rag of a skirt; all shook and gaped
and screamed, “<i>Daviety</i>.” She did not have her way,
however, and little Jason, for so I named him, remained
with me, and many a cheerful hour we spent together.
For days I amused myself watching his convalescence.
I caught flies for him and put them in his mouth, whereupon
he gulped them down and chirped. He slept
every night on the winter stove, and in the mornings he
flew down and hopped on to my face and chirped, and
then I would waken up and give him some sugar. I
took him out and he hopped along at the side of me on
the moors, and jumped and flew and caught flies for
himself. Often he got lost and I could not find him,
but after an hour or so, when I was lying down eating
my lunch, or picking wild strawberries from a bank, he
would hop again into view. He was a dear friend, my
little Jason.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of wild strawberries I made jam, as also of wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>plums and cherries, and this was a great diversion. I
offered some to Ali Khan next door, but he would not
take any; perhaps it was part of his religion to refuse, for
the jam was very tempting. Ali Khan made the
Persians very interesting to me, especially as there were
many Persians about and he was having one to tea
almost every day.</p>

<p class='c013'>The miller and his wife looked upon me with
parental eyes. They were much astonished by my
ability to do things for myself. The miller was generally
known as the Hözain and his wife the Hözaika.
The Hözaika stood and stared at me when I drew water
from the river myself; she thought it not respectable
that a man should do that, and when she came into my
back room one day and found me washing handkerchiefs
she fairly gasped. Poor Hözaika, she also
had her tables of conventionalities.</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />THE GORGE OF DARIEL</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'>LIVING in towns is enervating; it starves
both gods and devils. There the half-gods
of wit and conversation hold sway.
One morning I put a sovereign in my
pocket, slung my travelling bed over my shoulder, and
resolved to see more of the mountains. The sovereign
was in small change.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a dull, showery day, and the green trees clung
to the mountain sides like soft plumage. I walked the
whole day along the Georgian road and met no more
than two people beyond the little crowd packed into the
stage-coach. In the afternoon I entered the <i>débris</i> of
Larse, where the famous road enters the great mountains,
and I slept in the post-station within sight of the
great Ermolovsky stone, famous for its size, and for a
Russian poem which it inspired.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next morning I felt that my journey had begun.
For I was at the mouth of the Dariel Gorge. Two
versts from the station was the little red bridge which
clasps together the great rocks on either bank of the
Terek. They call it, as was, I suppose, almost inevitable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the Devil’s Bridge, and it looks enchanted. It is
overhung by gigantic cliffs, the great walls of the
corridor of the gorge. The river which rushes underneath
is something incomparably stronger than the
bridge itself; it is a monster wallowing, plunging,
roaring, thundering, lifting up a hundred dirty heads.
No horse or man would stand a chance in its current;
even the great glacial boulders, weighing tons, are rolled
over and over by its waves, and, shutting one’s eyes,
one listens to an uproar as of the heaviest streetful of
traffic on Cheapside.</p>

<p class='c013'>I think May is the best time to see the gorge, of a
morning at dawn. I was there before the sun had risen.
It was then indeed what a Russian has called it, “A
fairy tale in twelve versts.” There is little verdure
there except the grass, but the tops of the cliffs are snow-crested,
and just below the snow one sees, far away,
the hoar-frosted tops of woods. Below that are two or
three thousand feet of rock, brown with withered grass,
but brightened here and there by the greenest fir trees.
At the base the tortured rock seems wrought in cyphers
and frescoes, all twisted and lined as if a great history
had been told in hieroglyphics and letters that only some
past civilisation had been able to understand. But, as
someone has said, “Odin has engraved runes upon all
visible things—a divine alphabet intelligible only to the
thinking spirit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The cliffs are crowned here and there by the ruins of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>old towers, and the castle of Queen Tamara still stands,
a grim survival from the twelfth century when many
crimes were accomplished there. One still sees the
stairway in the rock along which unfortunate victims
used to be taken to be hurled into the foaming river.
Even below the ruins the clefts hold snow, and one sees
a rivulet of snow and ice descending to become a cascade
of bright water. From the river to the sky the whole
is harmonised by moss and lichen and ancient greyness.
It is a place where the stupendous majesty of Nature
troubles the soul, where one feels oppressed by the
immanence of powers greater than oneself, where one
knows in one’s heart how small and feeble is the little
earth-born creature Man beside those powers which have
fashioned the Universe and which move in the fir-hearts
of worlds.</p>

<p class='c013'>I sat on a stone and looked up. The perfectly blue
sky was spread across like a roof. The sun had risen,
but would not shine in upon me for hours. Meanwhile
I watched the light descending from the mountains,
and the sharp shadow picture of the rocks on my side
thrown on the rocks of the other. The shadow was
gradually climbing down.</p>

<p class='c013'>How clearly all sounds can be distinguished there!
The rocks preserve even the whisper. I notice that
when one comes out of the open into the shelter of a
gorge all sounds are trebled in volume and in distinctness.
One becomes aware of the music of the wind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the roar of the distant torrent; even the little rivulets
trickling down from the snow-drifts have a voice that
reaches the ear. The waterfalls have two voices, the
first a roar, and the second which the listener hears as a
secret treble.</p>

<p class='c013'>I walked on uphill past the boundary line into
Trans-Caucasia, past the Government fort and the
first free wine-inn of the new territory—the Russians
have allowed the vodka monopoly to lapse in Trans-Caucasia—and
came to the Devdorak glacier with its
long file of snow and ice. Here there was a large pile
of snow on the road, hard, firm snow six feet deep. It
had dropped from the heights. I walked on top of it,
and it was so hard that I did not even make foot-prints.
A man would stand a bad chance against a falling drift.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Devdorak is the Alexandrovsky Bridge, and I
crossed the Terek once more and came to the sunny
side of the gorge. A hot sun shone and a bracing wind
rushed round the corners of the serpentine road.
Butterflies purple and brown disported themselves, and
where the water oozed through the porphyry the rocks
were festooned with flowers.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />AT A VILLAGE INN</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>OUTSIDE Kazbek village two sheep-dogs
came up with a great show of ferocity, but
I pacified them. I have discovered that
they only do this because they are starved,
and that if one aims them a bit of bread they become
like lambs. The natives’ practice is perhaps more
efficacious. They pick up as big a piece of rock as they
can find, and hurl it point blank at the beast’s head.
I only counsel the reader, should he find himself in such
a predicament and not have bread, to offer them a
stone.</p>

<p class='c013'>I slept the night at the post-station at Kobi. Next
morning, when I went out to an inn to get some tea, it
was snowing, which rather surprised me, seeing that the
day before had been so hot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inn is one of eight shops in Kobi. The innkeeper
was of course delighted to see me. A customer
in May is a rarity. I had hardly seated myself when a
Russian lounger pounced on me and asked me the usual
series of questions about my name, nationality, destination,
business and so forth. He was dressed in home-made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span> sheepskin trousers and a Russian national
shirt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah,” said he, “the Englishmen know where all the
gold and copper is, and the oil; they’ve got it all mapped
out. The English know all. The Russians keep all—that,
my friend, is politics. The Caucasus is the brightest
brilliant in the Russian crown. We shall keep it to the
last. When all the rest is worked out we shall begin.
Here there is everything: gold, silver, coal, copper, iron—what
you like. Why, I know villages where there is
wild petroleum; it spurts out naturally, and the natives
have used it for years for cooking and lighting. Here
at Kobi we have seltzer water so strong that no one
can bottle it, and we drink it by the pailful. Full of
iron, my friend, that’s what makes us all strong. Nobody
ever dies here; that’s because of our springs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whilst I was having my tea I got him to speak of
the road. He was evidently a chatterbox.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They spend ten thousand roubles a year on the
road,” said he. “But that is nearly all absorbed by
overseers and generals; the poor working men get
little.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That also is politics,” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, we are all very poor,” put in the innkeeper.
“Eight shops we have, and not one makes more than
threepence a day profit. You see we have eight months
winter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will be better soon,” I urged. “The summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>is coming. But I see you don’t know much about
business. Now I know comparatively little about
trade, but my little finger knows better than you do
how to manage a shop like this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The shopkeeper blinked his eyes; he was an Ossetine.
Then the little man in the sheepskin trousers broke in,
“You would like to introduce American methods, but
you don’t understand how poor they are. They never
have any money in the winter. You couldn’t get
change for a rouble in the whole village now. They
spend all they get in the summer, and live on credit all
the winter. They owe you a fortune, Achmet, I’ll be
bound.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is only too true,” assented the shopkeeper.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little man went on: “Why, they even buy
two calf-skins of wine in the autumn when they have
money, and that lasts the family through the winter.
Not even an Englishman could do trade here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” I said, “what I meant was, soon the summer
will be here, and crowds of Georgians and Armenians,
Russians and Persians will be on the road. Now, this
being the first shop in the village, it stands best chance.
But why does our friend call the inn a drapery establishment,
and fill his window with oil-lamps and cheese?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The shopkeeper smiled with pride, and pointed out
that he was the only draper and lamp-seller in the
village. Whereupon I went on instructing him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you are the only draper, then everyone in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>village knows that fact, and there is no need to paint
it up as your sign. But travellers don’t want to buy
drapery or lamps. What you need to do is to write up
in big letters,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>INN</div>
    <div class='c000'>VARIOUS DRINKS</div>

    <div class='c000'>SAMOVAR READY</div>
    <div class='c000'>HOT SOUP.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then you’d make more than threepence a day. You
ought to try and get Russian visitors here: have some
rooms that could be let as lodgings, talk about the ozone
in the air and the springs in the rocks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They listened solemnly, and the innkeeper promised
to paint out his “drapery” sign. I had four glasses of
tea. I purchased two pounds of bread for my journey,
and all this cost but fivepence. Still, if he had no more
customers that day I supposed his takings would be up
to the average. I am sure they had a lively topic of
conversation for days to come about a real Englishman
who had shown them the way to make the village a
“going concern.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was interesting to observe the impression made
by the announcement that I was an Englishman.
Englishmen are rather a myth in these parts. The
wonders of London and New York must be taken on
trust, without vouchers, like the miracles of the Bible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and I daresay that when one of us does turn up they
take him as a sign which is not only sufficient guarantee
for the reality of modern civilisation, but also for any
points in their religion of which they may have doubt.
It is, however, much more likely that they would doubt
civilisation than the Bible, and they would accept the
authenticity of Elijah’s chariot sooner than that of
flying machines.</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />“THROUGH SNOW AND ICE”</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;TOOK the road to the Krestovy Pass. The
clouds lowered, and there was the promise of
much snow. It was bitterly cold, and the
mountains in front were dressed from head to
foot in white robes. Two versts from Kobi an avalanche
had fallen recently, so that the road would have
been impossible but for an emergency tunnel that had
providently been constructed at that point. Fifty men
were at work shovelling snow into the river-valley, which
was itself piled up in bergs of snow. I wondered what
was in store for me at the higher points of the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>The snow came thick and fast, and the wind blew
the tops of the drifts in my face. The snowy mountain
sides seemed to faint as the clouds came over them.
The river below me was absolutely hidden from view,
but it rushed rapidly under the snow. They say the
snow never completely melts from this river-bed, even
in the hottest seasons.</p>

<p class='c013'>I fastened my waterproof sleeping-sack about my
person, for it was so cold. The road had now on each
side of it an eight-foot wall of piled-up and drifted snow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>and in this wall little snow caves had been dug out to
allow the traveller or workman to take shelter in storms.
I was among the elements, high up among the snowy
peaks, with snow above and below. To the horizon ran
curve after curve of undulating snow. Yet as I stood
and listened I heard larks singing. There must be
sheltered valleys somewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five miles from Kobi the road was completely
closed to vehicular traffic by an immense heap of avalanche
snow, fifty yards across. Over the chaos was
a track fairly secure for pedestrians. Now and then
one went up to the knee in loose snow. It was a grand
pile which an English schoolboy would revel in.</p>

<p class='c013'>I marvelled at the new world I had so suddenly
entered. As the road grew higher all became whiter,
till earth and sky were one and there was no dividing
line. I felt among the clouds themselves. At Krestovy
Pass there was no view to be seen—the hurrying storm
closed in everything about my eyes. I looked downward
into an abyss of snow and cloud. Then for a
moment the storm seemed to be hurrying away from
me. The snow ceased to fall on the road where I stood,
but in front of me rushed in the gale. I saw the lines
of distant precipices, and beyond, the peculiar greyness
of the storm. Then the snow returned, and the wind
was like to take one’s ears off. The snow rushed past
with extraordinary velocity. Often now the road was
banked up fifteen feet with snow, so that one was in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>sheltered passage. Coming once more into the open, I
found the storm had slackened. A beam of the sun shot
through, and showed behind the flakes tall, ghostly
mountains with seams of awful blackness, where from
their steep sides the snow had fallen away.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the overtopping snow banks on the road hung
icicles a yard long, and the walls of the dark emergency
tunnels were sheeted with ice. In one of these near
Gudaour the ice against the rock wall was fifteen feet
high and three to eight feet thick. Huge icicles ten feet
long hung from the roof. The tunnel was a fairy grotto.
At the foot of the icicles were piles of little ice marbles
where the frozen walls had thawed; the fanciful person
might call them jewels. The whole was lovely to look
at, for the outside surface of the ice was glittering lacework.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was now going lower and I noticed that it was
milder—the snow was not so dry, and the roadway was
wet and muddy. I witnessed an extraordinary phenomenon,
the road steaming from the heat of the sun
shining through the clouds, and yet the snow falling
heavily all the time.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>AKHTSAURI GLACIER, KAZBEK</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The descending road has a sheer precipice on one
side, and the abyss might tempt the will of some people
if they ventured near the edge. It was a strange sight
to see the snow-flakes being blown upward out of the
valley of the River Aragva. I looked down three
thousand feet and saw the pleasant green of the south
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>country. I looked up to the north and saw the mountains
cloaked and grim, like sentinels sitting at their
posts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gudaour looked like the outskirts of Moscow in midwinter.
The snow was piled up on each side of the road
and on the cottage roofs. One would have said it was
the month of January for certain.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had two glasses of milk at one of the inns, and still
felt in very good form for continuing on the road. It
was an immediate descent, at first through slush of
snow, and then over mud, and finally along a dry, hard
highway. A thousand feet below the village it was
raining; the weather was decidedly mild. At one spot
it seemed to me I had located a type of English weather.
But for the mountains it might have been a wet February
day in Essex.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then I found again wild snowdrops and violets, and
the blackthorn was in bud. Two thousand feet below
there were cowslips and lilies, and there, to my joy, the
hot sun came out and clothed the spring in sparkles.
I slipped down to Mleti and found the summer there.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c015'>MLETI stands on the White Aragva, a beautiful
river of clear water, lifting thousands
of white foaming ripples. A
Russian poet has written:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Day and night runs the Aragva unweariedly over the stones,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And golden fish dart under the sapphire waves.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The road goes through the valley of the Aragva for a
distance of thirty miles through Pasanaour and Ananaour.
I went on towards the first-named village, expecting
to sleep there that night. But the unexpected happened.
About two versts from Mleti I was sitting by
the roadside when a priest came flying past me in a cart.
He was shouting and singing, going downhill as fast as
horse could carry him, and his long black hair streamed
in the wind. Half-standing, half-sitting in the cart,
he flourished a cudgel over the racing horse. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>he saw me he made a movement to stop, but he was
going too fast to pull up.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was beginning to rain, and I promised myself to
take shelter at the next inn along the road. I passed
Arakhveti, a typical Georgian village, having an old
church with a temporary tower of hay, and old hand-carved
Ikons outside the door. There were a few
cottages of the common type, having stone foundations
and an upper storey of basket-work. A mile beyond
this I came to a <i>Dukhan</i>, the first wine-house since Mleti.
And there I saw the priest again.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was sitting at a table outside the inn drinking
wine with a party of Georgians. A pitcher was in the
middle of the table and glasses all round. He hailed
me and said he would willingly have driven me had he
known in which direction I was going, and bade me sit
down and drink wine. Asked from what province I
came, I replied that I was English, which evidently made
a great impression, though they immediately took the
aspect of having met Englishmen every day of their
lives. I subsequently learned that I was the first they
had seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spoke among themselves in the Georgian
tongue, evidently discussing the democratic institutions
of Great Britain, and then the priest said to me, “They
keep us down, they don’t educate us; they forbid us to
have schools; they call us savages. What do you think
of us Georgians—aren’t we an unhappy nation? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>myself am not an educated man. I finished the
seminary, and then the Russian teacher said, ‘Georgian,
that is a dog’s language,’ and I gave up learning. But
these,” said he, pointing to his companions, “are as
ignorant as the sheep, they know nothing. I proposed
to build a school out of that old ruined barracks—it
would have cost nothing; we ourselves could have
built it, and I wrote a petition, but the Archbishop
wrote back saying education wasn’t necessary.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He bawled this speech at the top of his voice and
shook his abundant black hair. His name, as I learnt
afterwards, was Lavrenti Cham Khotadze; he was a
handsome man, tall and strong, with red face and
flashing eyes; his dense black eyebrows were too near
together, so that when he was excited he looked mad.
He had a fine long beard and a Roman nose. Over the
wine cups he was certainly very uproarious, whatever
he may have been in his church, and he emphasised his
opinions by striking the table with his whole forearm.
From head to foot he was enveloped in a dark blue
cloak fastened with a belt at his middle.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very dangerous political conversation ensued,
and we drank a series of revolutionary toasts, one being
that of the enemies of Russia—might they soon overcome
her, and so let the Georgians gain possession of
the Caucasus once more! They seemed to think that I
might write to the English papers and fan up political
animosity, and so help to bring about a European war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>which would give the Tsar so much to do that the
Caucasus would be enabled to gain its independence.
They wished me to set the world on fire “to boil the
Kaiser’s eggs,” as the saying is.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rest of the party were well-dressed Georgians,
but they did not enter into the conversation further
than to confirm what the priest said. They were
rather deficient in Russian. The priest himself a little
discouraged the use of the Slavonic tongue, and made
many malicious mistakes in his pronunciation when he
used it himself. He constantly referred to the teacher
who had called Georgian “<i>sobatchy yasik</i>”—dog’s
language—and he said to me, “Did God mean all people
to be alike, I ask you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I replied that I thought not.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are not a Mahometan,” asked one of the
men; “you profess Jesus Christ; you are orthodox?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I assented. “Orthodox” in Russia is as wide a
term as “Christian.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” said the priest, “God didn’t intend us all
to speak the same tongue or He would have given all
the same sort of faces. Now, look at my face, you can’t
call <i>it</i> Russian.”</p>

<p class='c013'>One of the party pulled a grey hair from the pope’s
head, and there was much laughter. But one of the
men said to me seriously:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t think that we are irreverent; we are only
joking, we are so happy to have met you.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>This man was a carpenter and he put his personal
case to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, I am a carpenter,” said he. “My father
was a carpenter; we make no progress. Motor-cars
come along the road. I don’t understand them, but it
is possible to understand them. If they taught me
mechanics I could make them. Motor-cars weren’t
made by God, were they? They weren’t even made
by generals. Working men like myself made them.
And haven’t I got eyes, hands and brain as they?”</p>

<p class='c013'>This was truly a beautiful utterance of its kind, and
said with a touching simplicity that won the heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Uproarious Lavrenti rushed on:</p>

<p class='c013'>“And the war against Japan which cost millions!
What do you think of their making the Caucasians pay
taxes? Why should we pay; did we order the war?
Did we fight it? Let those who ordered pay. Now,
if they’d sent me instead of old Kuropatkin, you’d have
seen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We drank a few more toasts and then it became
time to go. There was one round more in the pitcher;
the priest poured out a glass each and we all stood up
whilst the last toast was proposed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Mother of God save us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>We drank it solemnly, but I heard one man add
“some time or other.” Whereupon the priest laughed
whimsically.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lavrenti asked me to accompany him in his cart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and sleep the night at his house. On the way he
showed me his church—a chaste white chapel with a
little green dome; it holds a hundred people, never
more, and had been built in the ancient time when
Rurik was Tsar of Russia. It has its own Georgian
Ikons, though the Russians have taken out the precious
stones.</p>

<p class='c013'>His village was Nadiban. We did not get there
before dark, but I heard the music of the guitar, and
saw the youths and maidens of the village dancing
the <i>lezginka</i>. I went into the poverty-stricken dwelling
of the pope and saw his many little children. It was
evident that his wife grumbled at him for bringing me
home, and indeed there was no accommodation for
visitors. The poor woman felt shamed. They made a
bed up for me in a manger of the stable, and Lavrenti
apologised, quoting that somewhat out-of-date proverb
that “poverty is no sin,” adding that Christ Himself
had slept in a manger, and so perhaps I would not
object. His wife sent in a pillow and a quilt. I
wrapped myself up in my bed, and despite the snoring
of a sheep with a cold, and the attempts of an ox to
browse off my toes, I slept the sleep which is often
denied to the just.</p>

  <h2 id='ch21' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />ON THE ROAD TO TIFLIS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;TOOK my leave of Lavrenti at dawn and set
out for Pasanaour. A man with an ox-dray
picked me up two miles from the priest’s
dwelling, and carried me ten miles at a pace
slower than that of walking. The driver belonged to a
tribe dwelling on the Black Aragva, consisting of about
thirty thousand souls with a quite alien language and
distinct customs, the <i>Khevsurs</i>. For one thing, they
take their wives for a year on probation before marrying
them. This man spoke no Russian, but a Georgian boy
who was also being carried told me about him and his
people. He pointed out how dirty he was, and showed
a scar on his cheek and another on his wrist from knife
wounds. The Khevsurs are a very quarrelsome tribe,
and it is difficult to find a single grown man who has
never been wounded. They live by shepherding and by
wattle-making. Wattle is a very important manufacture
in the Caucasus; houses and fences are made of
it, and it is used for the embankments of the rivers.</p>

<p>GEORGIAN WOMEN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The ox-cart left the road at the confluence of the
Black Aragva with the White, and I was on my feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>again. Many people were on the road, and these were
more or less of a wilder type than those I had yet seen.
I observed that when a man and woman make a journey
together, the woman rides astride on horseback and the
man walks at her side. The favourite colour for dresses
seems to be a cloudy crimson.</p>

<p class='c013'>I found the road monotonously beautiful. The hills
were wooded to the top, the landscape was graceful.
Here were more <i>pretty</i> things than on the north side of
the Caucasus. One might have been in a park. Nature
did not seem entirely responsible for the scene; a
painter might have planned the grouping and effects;
the country was, in a word, picturesque. The road
seemed endlessly long, and I grew a little tired of it. The
sun, however, was bright and hot, and I made a siesta
among some rocks below the shelter of the road. There,
in a cleft, beside the clear, rushing stream, I had a
washing hour. It is wonderful how well one can wash
and dry a garment or so in an hour. I dabbled the
things in the water, and rubbed them and spread them
in the sun to dry. Meanwhile a wren kept coming to
and fro on tip-toe with thatch for a little house she was
building under the bridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the same time I also made a meal of bread and
sausage helped down with water. Mountain bread is
not good, but it has one advantage—it may be kept any
length of time without its quality being obviously
impaired.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Along the road are many extremely ancient ruins,
and also buildings of great antiquity still inhabited.
Clearly things last well in the Caucasian climate. The
castles and towers are but toys compared with Norman
ruins; they would have vanished utterly in England.
The walls are so thin and so poorly put together. It
seems that warfare has been rather more of a game than
with us. There have been no Cromwells there. The
churches, however, are often surrounded by high
battlemented walls, which suggests that though there
were no Puritans there were robbers in plenty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Near Ananaour a flock of sheep, about a thousand,
were driven past. One solemn shepherd marched in
front of his flock, and at the sides young men scolded
and yelled and kept the order with long poles. It was
a grand sight. I came into the village, where there is an
old Byzantine church with a castellated wall, and went
into a tavern to get some bread and cheese and wine.
Two men were at the table eating soup from one wooden
basin with only a single wooden spoon between them.
It was not really soup, but such a collection as no
Western person could face—boiled maize, garlic, raw
sliced onion, water and soaked bread. The two men
eating were evidently chums, for instead of using the
spoon each for himself, they helped one another, and I
was specially amused to watch the little bald man near
me shovelling the mixture into the mouth of his tall,
hairy companion. As they were drinking yellow wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and I red, the little bald man proposed a health, and
we changed glasses. Whereupon the company, for
there were many present, viewed me with the utmost
cordiality, and I shared among them the superfluity of
my cold brown pitcher.</p>

<p class='c013'>I set off towards Dushet, but feeling tired I spread
my travelling-bed on a grassy bank and fell asleep.
When I awoke it was dark and cold, and the sky was
in continuous sheet lightning. A damp breeze blew
briskly upon me and I was anything but comfortable.
I lay for hours half-dozing, but at length came to the
conclusion that it was better walking. Accordingly
I continued my walk to Dushet. It was two in the
morning, and even so early the sky promised dawn
from three sides. I had no notion of the compass.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very leisurely I made that walk. Ten miles is only
a short distance at night, and I did not wish to arrive
too early at Dushet. I promised myself hot tea, and I
must not come too early for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a strange night, starless, dark, full of flower
odours. I wished to drink, but every mountain stream
was chalky. I sat on many stones and scanned the
sky, hoping for the dawn. Dogs barked at me, and
even made to attack me, but of human kind I saw none.
I passed a beautiful dusky plum tree laden with blossom—she
was a woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>About half-past four I came into the district town of
Dushet, and at five o’clock behold me sitting in an inn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>waiting for the samovar. “It will be ready at once, in
an hour,” the innkeeper had said. On the wall of the
inn was a large coloured picture of the Last Judgment,
the good being led by angels to heaven, and the bad
being clawed down into hell by fiends; it was very
realistic, and caused me to recall the lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hear all the pedants’ screeds and strictures</div>
      <div class='line'>And don’t believe in anything</div>
      <div class='line'>Which can’t be told in coloured pictures.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The Georgians keep a good hot material hell in their
conception of the hereafter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The innkeeper was evidently only just up, and
didn’t intend to serve customers before he had washed
himself and put his shop in order. Accordingly, I
watched his proceedings. He had a small wash, and
combed his brown hair and moustache with two inches
of comb, swept up the refuse from the floor, and put
the empty bottles away. Large joints of mutton and
beef hung from the roof—the man was also a butcher—and
these he removed to a stall outside the shop. His
wife slept in a bed in a gallery above the counter, and
evidently slept too long, for her good man seemed to
hurl imprecations at her from time to time.</p>

<p class='c013'>At about half-past six the samovar, which had been
“drawing” in the yard outside the shop, was brought
in boiling, and I received what I had promised myself—four
glasses of hot tea, the innkeeper’s charge for which
was ten copecks—twopence halfpenny.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>I had no intention of walking this day. When I
had finished my breakfast I went half a mile along the
road and then sat down by the wayside. A quarter of
an hour later a van carrying hay came along, and the
driver offered to take me to Tiflis for a rouble. I lay
down on two bags of chaff and soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>After about two hours I wakened up to find myself
in heavenly circumstances; beautiful hills, a hot sun,
a cool breeze and a comfortable resting-place. The
driver also lay on two sacks and slept. The three
horses clattered ahead, evidently well knowing the
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>So all day we rolled easily over the road as in a
coach. The land was rich and beautiful, and the sun
glorified every beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Mtskhet, the ancient capital of Georgia, we stayed
for an hour, and I rested at a shop whose owners had
gone to Tiflis for the day. Two little girls were in
charge, and they gave me a dish of fish without knife or
fork, and on protest brought out a carving knife! The
elder girl was only twelve years old.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the twilight we sped along the banks of the Kuma
and arrived at Tiflis.</p>

  <h2 id='ch22' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />A TWO-HUNDRED-MILE WALK</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;WAS at Kutais in the beginning of May, and I
walked from that town two hundred miles
across the Caucasus to Vladikavkaz, which I
am told is a notable feat. It will certainly
remain very notable in my mind, both in respect of the
sights I saw and of the adventures I survived. I
ascended from the Italian loveliness of Imeretia, where
the wild fruit was already ripening in the forests, to the
bleak and barren solitudes of Ossetia, where I had to
plough my way through ten miles of waist-deep snow.
I was attacked by roughs at Gurshevi and escaped from
them only to lose myself on the Mamison Pass, where I
found the road overswept by a twelve-feet drift of snow.
I spent the night with shepherds on the pass in a koutan,
a shelter for cows and sheep, half-house, half-cave,
made of stones and mud. A shepherd showed me a
track over the snow next morning, and after five hours
of the most arduous walking I ever did in my life I
reached the other side of the Caucasus. But I arrived
there only to have a new adventure. A heavy snowstorm
had come on so that it was difficult to find the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>road, and at Lisri I inquired of a hillman lounging in the
way. This man arrested me as a spy and asked ten
shillings to release me, and since I refused to pay the
bribe I was hailed before the Ataman to give an account
of myself. Such account proving unsatisfactory, I
was formally arrested, and in fact remained a prisoner
for five days. Strangely enough I was hospitably
entertained during my captivity by chiefs and priests,
but the fifth night I spent actually in prison, in a dirty
Caucasian gaol with two robbers and a madman.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air of Kutais is pungent with the fragrance of
honeysuckle and sweet-briar, rhododendron and
azalea—it tickles the nose. I set off on a peaceful
Sunday morning when a sun hotter than we ever know
in England, even in July, was flooding the valley of the
River Rion with a superabundance of light and heat.
The road, eighty miles long from Kutais to Oni, is perhaps
the most beautiful in Europe, and this morning, its
forested mountains bathed in grey-green loveliness and
garlanded with flowers, it was a vision of Paradise. As
a Georgian priest had said to me, “When you get there
you will see; it is summer, everything is perfectly
beautiful. It is heaven. If one were sent there after
death one would not be disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I took it very easily this first beautiful day, and
between dawn and sunset walked not more than twenty
miles. The swallow-tail butterflies and large silver-washed
fritillaries sipping honey from bush to bush probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>strayed further than I did. I envied not at all the
dozen people crammed into the Oni stage-coach—a
vehicle constructed apparently out of currant boxes. In
fact, the shorter distance traversed in a day the richer has
been that day, one may say. The travellers on the stage-coach
certainly didn’t make a supper off wild strawberries
as I did. That was the reward of my first day’s sauntering.
I found them that day. I did not find any more.
The land became cooler and cooler, the next day and
the next, till it was obvious I was travelling out of
summer into winter again. But these strawberries
were rich; they were nearly as large as thimbles, and I
gathered about two pounds of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>I slept that night under a rock a hundred feet above
the road, and suffered no disturbance either from
robbers or from bears. A soft rain plumped down just
after sunset but I was in shelter. I slept, and indeed I
could not say what happened that night beyond that
the goddesses of sleep were gentle and kind to me.
Just before dawn next morning I was awakened to
hear the cuckoo calling from the dark forest opposite.
Something in myself craved hot tea. I jumped up and
took the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>I swiftly walked the eight versts to Mekhven, where
an innkeeper  was taking down his shutters, and I persuaded
the man to put up his samovar and give me tea.
Tea is a luxury in these parts, for wine is the cheaper
drink. It was no ordinary affair that a stranger should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>walk in at dawn and demand tea, and the innkeeper must
have told at least ten villagers of the fact before he put
a stick to the kettle. In five minutes his parlour was
full of the curious. That I was English seemed to make
a profound impression, but one man asked me whether
our country was in the direction of Tiflis, and another
whether it was nearer Persia or Japan. One thought
Queen Victoria was on the throne; another asked if
Russian was spoken in London, and were there many
Georgians there. I had my tea, four glasses, and then
drank the company’s health in a tumbler of red wine.
They replied, wishing me health on the road, and an
affecting reception when at last I reached my hearth and
home; might the English prosper and their king live
long over them!—no doubt to the gratification of the
shopkeeper, who filled a large pitcher from a half-deflated
calf’s skin under his counter. The population
were of the sort “never deep in anything but wine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The succeeding day was also one of full abundant
sunshine. My roadside companions were large yellow
rock roses and wild geraniums. In the woods I observed
wild walnut trees and raspberry bushes. What feasts
were promised for the later summer! I went forwards
towards Alpani, meeting many Svani upon the road, a
rather wilder tribe than usual, and very ignorant of the
Russian language. With many of these I shook hands,
however, that seeming to be the custom on the road.
Five miles beyond Mekhven three Russian tramp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>labourers, of the type Gorky represented, wanted me to
accompany them, but I declined. It was not easy to
keep clear of them, however, and we kept meeting one
another throughout the day. This was a day of thirst,
as indeed might be said of many succeeding days.
White wine and lemonade, red wine with radishes and
bread and salt—no shop seemed to purvey more solid
fare, and the only alternative to wine was water. But
there is water on the road better than in the shops. I
may safely say that if I have sampled all their wines I
have also tried all their waters and tasted all the rock
salts. There must be at least a score of varieties of
water along the road, from streams like dilute quinine
and iron to foaming seltzer water. In several villages
the people fill a bucket with seltzer water every morning.
Its taste is best just as it comes out of the rock.
Near Alagir the River Ardon is white with sulphur, for
there is an immense gushing sulphur spring there, and
a natural manufacture of sulphurous and sulphuric acid.
I suppose before ten years have passed someone will
have found it advantageous to work this spring. The
appalling smell of sulphuretted hydrogen should be
sufficient advertisement. Indeed, the richness of the
land from an industrial point of view, and its lack of
development, is a fact which is bound to strike a modern
European with wonder. Handsome copper and silver
ore and delicious-looking asbestite are to be found with
scarcely straying from the road.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>At Zhouetti I stepped into an inn, and when the
people heard I was an Englishman they sent across the
way to a factory there and brought a German to see me,
Herr Petersen, and we drank white wine and lemonade.
He judged I must be hungry since one could get nothing
fit to eat in these parts, and so ran back and fetched a
box of sardines. So with unleavened bread and hard-boiled
eggs I made a rough lunch there. At the factory
is prepared barite powder, used in the manufacture of
chintz. Herr Petersen was very kind, but counselled
me against the natives.</p>

<p class='c013'>I slept that night under a wall in a barley field and
was very cold, so the next night I chose a better place,
in the snug shelter of an overhanging rock, and screened
from view by a full blooming hawthorn bush.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the third day it rained much, and I spent some
hours in caves or under trees. The verdure had a
different aspect in the wet, and I reflected as I waited
that the spring is not advanced by rain, but it gathers
strength in the rain to proceed more quickly when the
sun comes out. So with the tramp!</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />CLIMBING INTO WINTER</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>THE Khvamli Table Mountain seems to stand
as a fort between the north and the south,
and it is an extraordinary sight. Its
uppermost two thousand feet are naked of
verdure. The grey cliff, a mile long, rises sheer from
the crests of a green forest and extends in a regular
battlemented array, which suggests a great city wall.
On one side of that mountain I found summer, and on
the other winter.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was an extraordinary experience to climb out of
an almost tropical summer into a land where the trees
were only just budding, and the snowdrop and crocus
were in bloom, and where the snow had not yet melted
from the road. I had started on a Sunday when the
weather approximated to that of July; on Friday I had
reached March, and on Saturday I was in mid-winter.</p>

<p class='c013'>I passed through Oni, an unusual town, in which
scarcely a new house has been built since the twelfth
century, and which is now inhabited by a tribe of mountain
Jews living in peculiar isolation. This was on
Thursday afternoon, and I spent the night in an inn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>nine miles north, at the little town of Utsera, now fast
becoming a popular health resort though a hundred
miles from a railway station. It is about the height
of Mount Snowdon, on the fringe of an ancient pine
forest. At Utsera it was raining on the Friday morning.
At the next village, Glola, a thousand feet higher,
the rain was changed for sleet. The road ascends
through a fir wood said to be the grandest in the
Caucasus; the pines are as broad-trunked as some of our
famous oaks, and they rise straight as a die to almost
incredible height. Their ancient hoariness and greyness
add to their majestic appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was now nearing the neck of the mountains and
stormy Mamison. The Rion, broad at Kutais, was here
but a small torrent. The road, if such it can be called,
was traversed by many cascades and broken away by
rocks and rivers, so that a horseman could pass only
with difficulty. To vehicular traffic it was completely
closed. Sitting at any point of the road one could count
literally scores of uprooted pines. Above Glola the
sun came out, the same hot Caucasian sun, though
tempered by the cold air, and, as if to pretend that
summer was there, the Camberwell Beauty butterfly (of
name obviously not universal) flitted to and fro flaunting
its purple and gold. Under the pine trees were wild
snowdrops thick clustered, and on the roadway even
little purple crocuses.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road became difficult to manage, two bridges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>having been entirely washed away. I had at one point
to leap fifteen feet on to a black snowdrift, which I
feared might give under me. But I succeeded and won
my way to Gurshevi. That was the first village of the
Ossetines, and had generally a bad name. Some
years ago an explorer and two guides disappeared
entirely in this region, and have never been heard of
since. And I had an adventure there which greatly
alarmed me. I had not stopped at the village; it was
difficult of access, being upon a cliff, and I strode forward
toward the pass. But a verst forward on the road
I was hailed from a distance by four roughs, who demanded
a rouble. I hurried on. They called “Stop!”
But I paid no attention, seeing that they were extremely
heavily clad and could not hope to catch me
up; they were in a valley about five hundred feet
below. The road, however, was extraordinarily tortuous,
and if I had only climbed straight up the cliff
to the pass I should have saved myself at least five
miles walking, and my encounter with the roughs into
the bargain. They were able to cut me off and get into
hiding among the boulders and rocks above the road.
My position was sufficiently dangerous, but I did not
guess their intention; they had no guns. Fortunately
I caught sight of one of them running from one rock to
another, and when I came to the district I stopped
short and demanded of my hidden enemies what they
wanted. For answer a large lump of rock came whizzing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>through the air within two inches of my head.
Had I been struck I should have been stunned. Whilst
I was deliberating a second followed, almost more terrifying
than the first, and coming with great force, being
hurled from above. No one was to be seen. There was
but one thing to do. I lifted up my legs and sprinted.</p>

<p class='c013'>I did not cease running till I was well up the pass
and in a region where there were no loose rocks to be
found. The snowy peaks had now become unveiled,
and the fir forest was left behind. I thought that if I
hurried I might get over the pass that day. My assailants
were far behind. I did not fear another
ambush. What was my surprise, however, to see suddenly
in front of me two men walking towards me.
Their dog rushed at me. I received him with equanimity,
being much more afraid of men than of beasts.
They told me there was no road for ten versts and would
not be for a month, and they advised me to go back to
Gurshevi. I listened with trepidation and could not
believe what they said. I agreed to their advice,
however, but said I would rest a little as I was very
tired, and bade them go on in front. When they were
out of sight I left the road abruptly and struck straight
up the turfy bank towards the pass. I crossed the circuitous
road three times and came to the region of continuous
unmelted snow. I dragged myself through a
mile of “slosh,” where a profusion of yellow water-lilies
were growing, and for the best part of an hour I strove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>to find the road again. When I found it and followed
it I came rapidly to snow too soft and deep to pass; indeed,
twenty yards in front the road was perfectly lost
in the snow, unmarked by undulation or rift in the even
whiteness.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was desperate, but I felt sure there was a way, for
I had heard of hillmen coming from Utsera, and had
been even counselled to wait for a companion there. I
resolved to get a shepherd to show me the way, and with
that in view climbed awkwardly downhill to the turfy
region, where a flock was browsing. Yes, there was a
way—one quite different from the road; an Ossetine
shepherd offered to show me for a shilling. I agreed on
condition that he first gave me a glass of milk, for I was
exhausted and had eaten nothing since morning. This
man was friendly enough, but on consideration he
thought it impossible to show me that night. I should
have to wait until next morning. I might sleep with
them in their koutan if I didn’t mind the filth; they
would make a bonfire and a big supper. His mate,
Gudaev, would play the fiddle; I could sing. He would
roast two quails which Achmet had killed; they would
all have a jolly evening, and to-morrow morning very
early he would take me and show me the track. Very
thankfully I agreed.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />A NIGHT IN A KOUTAN</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>CHEKAI and his companion shepherds living
in the koutan were clad in rags that were
extremely dirty, their faces red, unshaven
and wild, and their feet and legs bare,
except of dirt. They were extremely apologetic.
“You are clean,” said Gudaev, “but God has given us
to work in filth, as you see, but we are men and Christian
Ossetines.” I put them at their ease with a smile and
went to inspect the koutan. It was an extensive
dwelling, for the most part dug out of the mountain
side. The walls were made of boulders plastered
wind-tight with stable filth, the roof of pine branches,
peat and hay. There were no windows, and so the whole
had no light beyond what came in at the door, or from
the hole in the roof; but what light there was sufficed to
show that the house was divided by fences into a number
of compartments for the reception of horses, cows,
sheep and goats.</p>

<p class='c013'>One of these compartments, in the shelter of a
ponderous rock, was the shepherds’ own room. Three
bits of fir trunk made the seats, and between these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>trunks and the walls were the beds of hay where they
slept. Under the rock the red-grey embers of last
night’s fire still smouldered. I went in and sat down,
being tired and cold after my wanderings in the wet
snow on the pass. Chekai and his companions milked
the cows, brought in the horses and the sheep, separated
and drove into separate pens the rams, the ewes and the
lambs, so that the dark koutan became full of the cries
of animals. I myself assisted in the separating of the
sheep, for Chekai, who had asked my name, kept calling
out, “Stepan, come here,” “Stepan, go there,” and I
was fain to obey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Achmet brought me the two quails he had killed,
and showed me them with pride. He must have been a
sure marksman with stones, and I thought with some
ruefulness of my recent encounter when I had been
somewhat in the position of the poor quails, but I said
nothing. Gudaev, having milked the cows, took up the
business of hacking firewood out of a tough pine log.
In his intervals of rest he brought armfuls of wet
branches and put them on the fire. I was given a
wooden basinful of fresh milk, which Achmet had
strained through hay before giving me. Presently the
animals were all housed and a bonfire made up on the
rude hearth. Clouds had crawled once again into the
evening sky, there was a flash of lightning and a
long roll of thunder; the dancing hailstones rushed
down, and following them thick, soft, flaky snow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>I was glad I had not tried to cross the pass that
night.</p>

<div id='i200'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i200.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A KOUTAN</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was very dark, and the wet wood was filling the
koutan with smoke, but Chekai, who had cut up a great
number of little sticks, made a brilliant illumination by
setting fire to them. They had a contrivance of tin
about three feet from the ground, and in this they
burned the resinous pine splinters for hours. At
length the brushwood burst into flame and dried and
caught the thicker branches; in half an hour we had a
roaring big fire. Gudaev hung a large iron pot over it
and boiled water; Chekai settled down to pluck the
quails; Achmet prepared to make bread. When the
water had boiled Chekai informed me they would make
copatchka. Achmet took maize flour, salt and milk
and boiling water, and kneaded a dough into flat cakes
about the size of soup plates. Gudaev stood them on
end in front of the fire, and toasted them first one side
and then the other. When they were done he buried
them under the grey-red ashes and left them to cook.
This done, he took from a wooden peg in the mud of
the wall an iron violin with two strings, and commenced
a tune of that sighing and moaning and shrieking
style characteristic of Caucasian music. Chekai
sang, and all the while plucked the little quails. When
the birds had been quite disfeathered, singed and
cleaned, the shepherd transfixed them together on a
stake and toasted them at the fire. Achmet filled up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the pot over the fire with milk, flour and salt, thereby
preparing soup.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had fallen back asleep when suddenly Chekai
called out, “Stepan, get up and eat!” This I was not
loth to do, and in a minute behold me tasting for the
first time hot copatchka and roast quail. It must be
said the bird was tasty though it was small. The milk
soup made my teeth dance, it was so hot. Chekai
began a conversation. “What are the English—Christians
or Mahometans?” asked he. “Is England
far away? Where does it lie?” I replied that
it was four or five thousand versts to the north-west.
Chekai whistled. “Beyond the mountains?”
said he. “And have they such poor and dirty
people there? Look how poor I am, look how I’m
dressed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I expect you’re not so poor as you look,” said I.
“The owners of the sheep must pay you well, but you
leave the money in the village with your wife and family,
or your mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The shepherd frowned and then grinned. I had
apparently hit on the truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The time came to make an end of the feast and lie
down to sleep. They gave me the best place between
a fir plank and a sheep fence close to the hot embers.
I covered myself entirely up in my travelling-bed, and
was secure in that both from vermin and from dirt. The
three others disposed themselves in different parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>smoky cavern and began to snore horribly. I slept
heavily.</p>

<p class='c013'>At dawn, through custom, I awoke. Chekai was
already stirring and had gathered fresh wood for the
fire. He warned me it was necessary to hurry if he was
to show me the track, for he had much work to do. I
showed immediate alacrity. The weather seemed
promising, and I was full of hope that I should reach the
other side of the mountains in time for breakfast. We
had a ten minutes’ parley over money. Chekai wasn’t
quite sure that he couldn’t hold me up to ransom <i>à la
Hadgi Stavros</i>. But he was eventually content to receive
half-a-crown, together with the present of a pretty
water-jar I had bought a week before in Georgia, and
which he coveted. In exchange for the water-jar he presented
me with his staff, which was stout and long and
served me better in the long run than I could have
guessed. I ought to have taken another meal of
copatchka and milk before starting. A bottle of vodka
in my pocket would not have been amiss. I did not
dream that after two hours’ walking my heart would
be beating so violently through exertion that I should
fear to perish in the snow.</p>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />OVER MAMISON</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;FOLLOWED my guide Chekai over the mountain
marsh, where hundreds of bright yellow
water-lilies were in blossom. The sun had just
risen, the clouds were very white, and the clear
sky was lambent greenish blue. “It’s going to be fine,”
said the shepherd. “You’ll get across safely. In an
hour you will come to the Southern Shelter, a white
house; you can go in there and rest, and one of the
soldiers will show you the way on. After the pass there
is another house, but if it is stormy you won’t be able
to see it for the snow. Never mind, you will hear the
bell. There are two men on duty night and day, and
they are obliged to ring the big bell whenever it is
stormy. Perhaps they don’t ring it now in the winter,
I don’t know; I’ve never been over before June when
the road is black. Not more than four Ossetines have
been over this month, but the soldiers go backwards
and forwards seven or eight at a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We came to the margin of the unmelted snow and
followed a track for about a mile, and then my companion
began to complain that his feet were getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>frozen, and I told him that if I was now on the right
track I could dispense with him; he might go back.
This evidently he was glad to do. I paid him a rouble
in small change, every coin of which he said was bad,
and we had to test them separately on a bit of rock
before he would be satisfied. We then exchanged
presents, blessed one another and parted.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was walking on a white carpet apparently boundless.
To right and to left and ahead the rocks lifted
themselves aloft in white masses. In the sky the
clouds, torn as by storm winds, rushed hither and thither,
now veiling the peaks and now the road, or filtering upward
and downward at the neck of the pass. Here is
the place where the weather is manufactured and
shared out between north and south. The sky promised
everything on the shipman’s card. The sun
suddenly shone out and flashed over all the snow with
blinding brilliance, and then almost as suddenly became
overcast as a foaming wave of cloud was tossed over it.
I began to fear that the mists might hinder my crossing,
or keep me waiting for hours on the desert of snow,
afraid to go forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ascent became more arduous. The snow was
softer, and the surface not frozen hard enough to bear
me. At every third step I sank to the knee; the staff
the shepherd had given me saved me once or twice, but
I could never tell when I should be upborne by the snow
and when I should sink. After half a mile of this I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>stopped and gasped. I thought I couldn’t get on.
Storm, however, threatened. I must go on. I took
another step and sank as deep as it is possible for one
leg to go. In pulling myself out I fell on one shoulder
and almost went out of sight. It was like the hindered
progress in a nightmare. I must have rested ten
minutes before I set forward again, and walked fifty
yards by three steps and a fall irregularly along the
faint track. I felt like Dorando at the finish of his race
at Earl’s Court.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour’s struggle brought me to the Southern
Shelter, a military station cold and uninviting, but even
so a delight to my eyes, a very oasis in the wilderness.
I saw no one there, and therefore did not stop. It
seemed to me I must soon reach the summit. I was,
however, destined to disappointment. The track now
led up a steep bank, a weary way. I was constantly up
to the waist in snow, and not a step that I took seemed
to grip or take me appreciably forward. To add to the
difficulties, the snow of last night’s storm had almost
completely effaced the track; it was only with the
greatest difficulty that the eye discerned and traced the
way. One false step and I should have gone slithering
over the snow into the abyss like a riderless sledge.
The clouds above my head massed and the snow-flakes
hurried down. I sat down on my travelling-bed and
surveyed the grim, silent snowstorm; to me it was then
a dreadful sight, and I began to ask myself if this would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>not perhaps turn out to be my last upon this bright
world. A flash of lightning and the long roll of thunder
quickened my fears. I started up again and battled
forward. It was an almost heart-breaking business
truly. Every ten yards I came to a standstill with
heart palpitations, caused partly, perhaps, by the rarity
of the atmosphere—I suppose at nine thousand feet the
atmosphere is rarer—but caused in most part, without
doubt, by my exertions; and my sunburnt hands had
become violet in colour. All about me the storm raged
and the mist hid the crest of the pass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder rolled once more, and then unexpectedly
the sun shone through the snow-flakes. The
veiled mountains looked like workmen disturbed while
up to their eyes in some job. I looked along my way
to the crest of the mountain. It seemed to lead right
up into the sky. It would have been an ideal road
for the poet Davidson. I whispered to myself his lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“Alone I climb</div>
      <div class='line'>The rugged path that leads me out of Time.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Then, after what seemed ages of slow dying, I saw in
front of me the cross which marks the highest point of
the pass. I did the impossible; I reached that cross.
The reader may imagine the bliss I experienced sitting
on my waterproof at its foot. Even if I perished in the
descent I had now been a victor; henceforth there were
no more Alps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Downward was not so difficult. I even ran as if on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>skis till I realised the danger of breaking my legs. It
was a delightful contrast, however, the slipping downhill,
the falling, jumping, plunging downward. My
heart was light.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had not descended five hundred feet before I saw
an extraordinary sight—a hanging, frozen avalanche
waiting for the snow, a long, high wall of fixed but
sliding snow frozen and glittering, myriadfold icicled,
and not white but pale green. Seen from below the
long pale-green wall looked ominous beyond words. A
new danger now presented itself to my mind—that of
being swept away by falling snow—and suddenly this
was emphasised. I heard a long, low, sullen roar that
could not be thunder, but which I could not locate. It
was followed by a second which seemed an echo, and by
a third. Then, looking to a peak, I saw the cause of one,
a falling drift of snow. I saw the slow-moving white
descending, descending, and then suddenly splashing
over the cliff in brown mud. Fast after and before
followed the stones. The danger from falling drifts
was imminent, and I kept my eyes open. The storm
cleared. The bell was not ringing at the bell-house,
and I did not stay there. On my way down I met a
man toiling upward, and I felt exceedingly overjoyed,
and thought to talk with him, but he was pale as a
ghost and utterly exhausted. Beyond greeting, and an
inquiry as to the state of the road, I got no further word
from him.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>In half an hour I was out of the snow on to the
black road, and presently I came to the first village on
the north side. The inhabitants all gathered round me
and stared, and asked where I had come from and congratulated
me. One old man in particular shook hands
with me, effusively calling me <i>molodetse</i>, “fine fellow,”
and everyone seemed to combine to smile upon me. I
was happy. One thing, however, was wanting—food.
The village could only supply me with cold copatchka
and salt.</p>

  <h2 id='ch26' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />ARRESTED</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;HAD been tramping almost three weeks when I
crossed the snow of Mamison. I was therefore
full of longing for the comforts of the town and
calculated that in three days I should clear the
remaining hundred miles and be resting in snug quarters.
I was, in fact, full of such thoughts as I reached the
village of Lisri, but, as Leonid Andrief says, “Man
shall never know the next step for which he raises his
tender foot.” At Lisri I was arrested.</p>

<p class='c013'>The village is a straggling one, built out of grey stone
and put together from the remains of ancient ruins.
In the barrenest of pasture land, and having no more
than three months’ summer, it is strange that anyone
should have chosen to live there. Yet there is a large
population of Ossetines. What they do beyond shooting
bears and wild oxen by day and listening to the
wolves at night it would be difficult to say. This day,
however, there was unusual animation in the place.
The priest had summoned all his parishioners and laid
before them a proposal to build a new church and enlarge
the school. It was a festive occasion, and probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>more spirits were drunk that was conducive to my
safety. In Ossetia there is little wine, but all the
natives drink <i>Araka</i>, a home-brewed spirit suggesting
gin in appearance but possessing the odour of stale
whisky. It is made from fermented maize.</p>

<p class='c013'>The man who arrested me was a primed villain. He
reported me to the Ataman as a spy, and said I pretended
to be ignorant of the Georgian language, but
that he had trapped me into using some words of that
tongue. He did not say he had offered to release me
for ten shillings, and that he had proposed to discuss
the bargain at a lonely point of the road two miles
outside the village, and wished to accompany me
thither. I had a very likely fear that he would have
cut my throat and pushed me over the cliff into the
snowy Ardon valley. He reminded me forcibly of some
words a Russian had said to me: “The Ossetines have
a tariff now—to lay a man out, one rouble; to murder
him, three roubles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I argued, coaxed, threatened, bluffed, all without
avail: my captor was merciless. I must say I mistrusted
him dreadfully, and I would not have paid the
bribe had I had the money ten times over. I went back
to the village and he followed me. I tried to inveigle
him into conversation with a group of villagers. I
appealed to them and told my story in Russian; they
favoured me, and told the fellow to let me go. With
their moral support I attempted an escape, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>should have got clear away, but for the fact that at that
moment a party of horsemen were coming down into
the village and I was cut off by them. My captor
was not angry; his only concern was to get me by
myself. My care was to start a big dispute with each
newcomer. At length I demanded to be taken to the
Ataman, and in this I was successful. The man who
arrested me wanted me to come home with him, but I
outwitted him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was brought to the village schoolroom, where the
priest was holding his meeting. Fifty men seemed to
be all shouting at once. The business in hand was
interesting; the clergyman had called them together to
do work, provide material and offer money for the construction
of the new buildings, and also to discuss the
plans. A church in an Ossetine valley costs little; it is
made of stone and pine without windows or seats; the
whole village is idle and ready to build a house of God
for themselves just as they would build a new cottage.
The question of wages is not heard. Ruskin himself
could not have wished for a more complete absence of
the principles of the “dismal science.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the moment I entered I saw that the priest
would be my friend. I was feeling desperately tired
after climbing Mamison. I had used all my wits to get
clear of the Ossetine, and now I fell back in exhaustion.
I answered or failed to answer the questions of the inquisitive
for hours. The Ataman came and questioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>me lazily; in his heart he cursed his lieutenant for
arresting me. He said to the people, in the Ossetine
language, that if I escaped none was to hinder me.
Several signalled to me to bolt, for everyone looked very
kindly. But my captor hung on; there was no escaping
him. He got me alone again, and tried to bully me with
words into paying him the ten shillings. This was in
the now empty schoolroom. I insisted on marching up
and down, for it was cold, and for a quarter of an hour I
listened to the man swearing at me.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the priest sent for me, and I was glad to get
into better company. He was still surrounded by a
crowd of villagers, but he saved me from my captor,
taking me by a side door, and handing me over to his
womenfolk to feed. I felt the brotherhood of educated
men all over the world as he said to me <i>sotto voce</i>, “I
am sorry to see you, a cultured man, in such a plight.”
His wife was very kind to me and brought me minced
mutton and scones and araka and tea. I felt myself
in a quiet haven out of the storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>My captor made two further attempts to gain
possession of me, and even succeeded once, under pretext
of taking me to the Ataman. But when I found
I was being taken to his home I refused to move a step,
and seeing the priest in the distance I shouted to him
and ran towards him. The upshot of a long dispute
was that the priest overruled the fellow and took me to
his own house for the night. I returned, and Khariton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>for such was his name, accompanied me. We had a
new meal, and my host put off his priestly garments
and made merry. He and his wife were a very young
couple who were very fond of one another, and played
practical jokes of an elementary order, such as pulling
one another’s hair—the priest’s hair being almost as
long as his wife’s.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the impressions of a very pleasant, convivial
evening, what will chiefly remain in my memory is the
discovery by Khariton of a small geography book, from
which he read in a loud voice all that was said both in
large print and in small about England. England had
at last become for them an actually existent country.
The good man had, however, seen an Englishman
before. Some years ago one came up the valley
prospecting for minerals. He could not speak a word of
Russian, and he sat so funnily on his horse that all the
natives laughed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Did I know Professor Müller—professor of Asiatic
languages at St Petersburg? He was a man to know.
He came to Lisri some years back, and conversed with
the natives in their own language so perfectly that they
thought he must be an Ossetine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Khariton! he did not really know much of
education. He confessed to me he was ready to die of
shame when he had to speak with an educated Russian.
But the Ossetines had few chances. It would be better
later. They had schools and were learning. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>teaching the village what he knew, little though that
were. They had, moreover, arranged for the improvements—on
the morrow all that had been volunteered
would be written down.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>AN OSSETINE DWELLING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I asked him what would happen to me. He thought
I should be released. Had he been in my place he
should have died of fright, he said. But I might be
easy in my mind. The Ataman had received a circular
from the Governors, and he did not understand its
meaning. He would probably send me to the next
village, to the Ataman of Zaramag. The latter was an
educated man and would see that a mistake had been
made.</p>

<p class='c013'>At ten o’clock Khariton and his wife spread a bed
for me on the floor and I was glad to lie down. So, with
slumber closing weary eyes, ended for me this distressing
and adventurous day.</p>

  <h2 id='ch27' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />FIVE DAYS UNDER ARREST</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>NEXT morning I was sent under escort to the
village of Zaramag, ten miles distant.
But before starting Priest Khariton said
to me, “I see that you have some of our
copatchka in your satchel; permit me to give it to our
dog, my wife will give you something fit to eat.” And
the kind woman filled my bag with scones and cake and
eggs.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was sent in charge of a very old man to the Ataman
of Zaramag. I might easily have escaped, but it seemed
more interesting to remain a prisoner. Outside Lisri
he showed me a pool of human blood on the road where
there had been a fight the night before. They are
evidently rather rough in this district. I felt rather
safer as a prisoner than if I had been at liberty.</p>

<p class='c013'>We passed several small villages, one of which was
Tli, an accumulation of broken-down towers; twelfth-century
ruins patched together for the housing of the
people of to-day. We were stopped here; someone
called to us from the cliff. “There is a man dead,”
said my escort. “We must go up here.” We climbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>up accordingly, and found all the men of the village
collected together, sitting on pine logs. Two men
came rapidly forward to greet us, and we stood as it
were on a threshold, while these proclaimed something
in a loud voice in the Ossetine language. I think it
meant, “In the name of the Father, the Son and the
Holy Ghost. Amen,” or the equivalent of that. We
took off our hats and crossed ourselves, I following the
example of my companion. With that someone took
our things from us and put them aside, and we entered
into the assembly and took seats on the logs. Everyone
had goats’ horns, from which they were drinking,
and a vessel of that kind was brought to me full of
<i>araka</i>, and with it hard-baked millet cake and salt.
Everyone seemed to be serious, and to judge by the
activity of three men going to and fro with copper
kettles replenishing the horns, all were drinking hard.
He who had died had been a very poor old man, but
if he had been twice as poor and twice as miserable in
his life I am sure his death would have none the less
proved an excuse for the glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Ataman of Zaramag was present, and my guard
gave him the letter, in which he was asked if he knew
anything against me, or who I was. He said the letter
was unintelligible to him, and that I should have to be
sent back, but all the same he sent me on to Zaramag
to wait for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I waited there all day with a drunken Russian clerk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>who wanted to borrow money to buy a quart of <i>araka</i>
in order to drink my health. His wife, however, to
save him the disgrace, now produced a bottle which she
had previously hidden from him, and he proceeded once
more to add water to the ocean.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was yet early in the morning, but I spent the rest
of the day with the man and his wife, drinking tea and
listening to the confused boastings and witticisms of
the drunkard. The Ataman remained at the burial-feast.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the afternoon I grew tired of waiting and said I
would walk on to the next village, and that if the
Ataman wanted me he could send for me, and I strolled
out accordingly. The clerk seemed paralysed by
faith, and just sat and stared in amazement. I walked
out of the village and took the road. There, however,
I met the Ataman, who smiled amiably and re-conducted
me to the abode of the clerk.</p>

<p class='c013'>I spent that night in an almost sumptuous apartment
in the house of the Ataman. First he entertained
me at dinner, and we ate mutton and drank sweet
Ossetinsky beer from a wooden loving-cup. Obviously
being arrested has its advantages.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day I was sent to the Ataman of Nuzal,
asking what he had to say about me. For some time
I had thought I should have been returned to Lisri,
but the drunken clerk had intervened and advised
that I be sent further. The boy who should have taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>me went without me, however, and I was put into the
charge of a carter going that way.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road now led downhill, and I left the snow
behind. The valley of Zaramag, which might be called
a nursery of rivers, has a wild beauty, though it came
harshly upon my eyes after the soft luxuriance of the
South. We followed the river Ardon through the
wonderful gorge of Kassar. The little thread of road
runs unobtrusively through ten miles of ruined cliffs.
Far below the little river agonises, roars and conquers.
The height, the depth, the gloom, the chaos of decay
and ruin—these appal the vision. It is more dreadful
and uninhabitable than the gorge of Dariel, a dangerous
district, moreover, where man needs fear the bear and
the wolf. Above a glacier my guide pointed out to me
specks which he said were bison.</p>

<p class='c013'>We arrived at Nuzal in the afternoon and there a
comedy enacted itself. The Ataman refused to receive
me or to have anything to do with me, declaring he
had no authority to arrest me. “What shall I do?”
asked the carter. “That’s nothing to do with me,”
answered the Ataman. “Do you hear?” said the
carter to me. “The Ataman won’t take you; go and
beg him to take you, or else you’ll have to go back to
Lisri.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shan’t go a single step back upon the road,”
said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will be forced,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“Then I shall be forced,” I replied. “They’ll have
to carry me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what shall I do?” asked the carter. “I’m
going to Ardon on business. I can’t take you back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No one would have anything to do with the poor
man. A Russian visiting doctor came up and talked
to me, and when he heard of the dilemma he was like
to die of laughter. The idea that the Ataman of a
remote village should have arrested a European tourist
tickled him immensely. He promised to write my
story in the Russian newspapers. “Let him go,” said
he; “and as for that,” pointing to the letter, “throw it
away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must have a receipt,” said the carter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll give you one,” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>The upshot was, however, that I agreed to go a
stage further, to Misure, where there is a silver factory
and a telephone to Vladikavkaz. It was a Belgian
factory, and M. Devet was a very nice man. I agreed
to that, but at Misure the telephone was out of order,
and beyond drinking a bottle of wine between us we
gained no comfort there. I counted myself free really,
for certainly the carter was without authority, but it
was interesting to see what would happen next, and I
forebore to escape. The man cursed his stars for having
taken me, but he was obsessed by a sense of duty. He
would take me on to Alagir and hand me over to the
Pristav there. To Alagir we went accordingly. <i>En</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span><i>route</i>, however, we slept in a little shop by the wayside,
and it was not till next morning that we passed through
the gorge of Ardon with its hot sulphur springs, and
came to the large settlement on the steppes known as
Alagir.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the Pristav’s office we had to wait five hours,
and I was assured I should be liberated, but then I
found they dared not release me. I had to go to Ardon,
fifteen miles distant.</p>

<p class='c013'>As I was leaving Alagir there was a strange incident.
A well-dressed man, whom I mistook for a member of
the Russian Secret Police, came up to me, and tried to
get me to say things against the Russian Government
and my treatment. “You can speak to me as to a
mate,” said he. “I also am a <i>politikan</i>. What happened
to you? You are exhausted. Never mind.
Bear up.” He spoke a few words aside to my guard,
and then went on again. “I have arranged,” said he.
“You won’t go just yet. You must come along with
me and have a meal, then I will take both of you in a
cart, and we can have a chat.” I felt suspicious and
refused.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile two young men came up and entered
into conversation with him, and they asked me my
story. I told them, and one said, “We represent the
Society for the help of educated Ossetines in distress;
we beg you to receive our help.” Then one gave me
five separate ten-copeck pieces and a slip of paper with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>his address, saying, “If you are in difficulty write to
me. You will need money before you are released—to
this little you are welcome.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again I refused and thanked them profusely.
Then the first man said he must have offended me. I
insisted that he hadn’t, and we parted. I have every
reason to believe that they were very honest and good
people, though their manner was not very assuring.
My guard, who had patiently waited, now went on and
I followed.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Ardon I was sent to a place called Ard-Garon,
where I spent the night at the house of a hospitable
Ossetine. I arrived in the evening, and my host took
me out for a walk on the steppes to what he called a
“mayovka,” so called because it was held in the month
of May. It was an evening picnic of about fifty
Ossetine men. There were no women. They had
buckets of <i>araka</i> and baskets of mutton and bread. I
politely partook of their viands.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Ard-Garon I was exported to Gizel, where my
good fortune seemed to suffer eclipse. I was thrust, in
spite of my protests, into the village gaol, there to exist
from three in the afternoon till eight next morning.
I had had nothing to eat all day and nothing was obtainable
here. Only, in answer to my complaint, the
gaoler put in a pail of dirty water that I might drink if
I wanted to.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Ardon an official had said to me, “We can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>keep you here because we’ve nowhere to put you. You
wouldn’t like to lie in prison, would you? Have they
prisons in England?... Clean ones, I suppose.
But ours are dirty. Would you like to see ours?” He
burst into a guffaw of laughter. But the Ataman said
to him, “No, no, you needn’t go out of your way to do
that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I suppose the place was ugly. I did not guess that
on the succeeding night I should be for the first time in
a Russian gaol.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a verminous cell, with holes in the rotten
flooring and no glass in the barred windows. The door
was cased in iron; the walls hung in tatters of broken
plaster. There were no seats, but at one end some
planks served for a bed. My companions were an
Ossetine and an Ingoosh, both charged with stealing,
and a madman, who was, I understood, a regular
tenant of the den. I had obviously nothing to do with
these people and didn’t belong to their class. They
were as selfish as possible, and I suppose I should have
had a bad night but for the fact that I was so worn out.
I huddled myself together on the planks and slept. At
Vladikavkaz next day, the Chief of Police inspected
my passport, and bade me take my liberty and “live
with God.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch28' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />MR ADAM</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>TRAMPS often bring blessings to men. They
are very brotherly; they have given up the
causes of quarrels. Perhaps sometimes
they are a little divine. God’s grace comes
down upon them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certainly one day I met a noble tramp, an Eden
tramp. He came upon me at dawn with a wood smile
on his old face. He was one of the society of tramps;
he knew all Russia, its places and peoples, and he called
himself Mr Adam. Why did he adopt that name—why
had he thrown away the other name? These were
questions he was not in a hurry to answer. They involved
a story. Such a story! It sounded in my ears
like a secret melody of the world. But first let me say
how I met this most jovial wayfarer.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had slept one night by the side of the road among
nettles and thistles. My pillow was a stone, my bed
soft, dusty earth. I was so near to the road that the
lumbersome, creaking ox-carts, that approached and
passed in the night, seemed within arm’s reach—so near
that I felt the movement in the air as they passed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Horses snorted uneasily now and then, and once in the
early morning a dog came snuffing among the herbage
after me. It was a night of dew and dust. I do not
suppose I slept more than three hours, but it did not
seem a long night. The approach of dawn came as a
surprise to me. I was glad to think it was dawn even
if it should turn out to be an illusion. My bed was
too cold and fresh, my eyes seemed clammy and sticky,
as if spun together with gossamer threads, my forehead
was heavy as iron, my body seemed long and ponderous
as that of a trold. Everything in me waited for the sun.
A night on the mountains gives its peculiar refreshment;
it nurses each limb in cold, dewy air, and transmits its
influence in cold thrills into the very depths of one.</p>

<p class='c013'>I sat up and surveyed the scene in the half light, and
what was my surprise to see an apparently monstrous
figure of a man coming toward me along the road. I
almost feared him, but I soon saw his peculiar smile of
geniality and my fears gave way. This was Mr Adam.
He came up to me as if he had known me from the
cradle. The usual greeting and question passed, and
then he pulled out of his ragged overcoat a chunk of
bread and some hard white cheese, and sat down on a
stone with the evident intention of breakfasting. I
bade him wait whilst I filled my kettle. Whilst I went
to get water he lit a fire. We had a very cheery meal.
He cut his bread and cheese with a rusty dagger!</p>

<p class='c013'>He told me how he came to take the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Adam, in memory of an old companion of the road who
made a poor woman in Vladikavkaz very happy. This
is the story. There was a man named Peter who died,
leaving a widow and three children. The woman was
very young and had a baby at her breast and was without
money. When she had paid for priest and coffin
there was little left her. Her husband had been a
writer in a railway office; he wrote envelopes and
copied letters. He only received forty roubles a month
and was very improvident. Though perhaps it was not
he, but Society, that was improvident; for his wife was a
good woman and her children worthy. And when one
is young one does not expect to die.</p>

<p class='c013'>Anna, for such was her name, had to leave the house
where Peter had died. She had to step down in the
world. She took one room in a little cottage, and lived
there, and waited to starve. Neighbours helped her,
but they were very poor, and her babes, like young
birds in the nest, all stretched out their mouths to her
and cried.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a bare room. The family slept upon the floor.
There was an old table that had been lent to them, and a
stool and a box. In a corner the Ikon picture gleamed.
The woman was little clothed, and the children showed
their little white bodies. So much had been sold to get
a little money for food that even the samovar was not
seen. Neighbours coming in held up their hands in
pity of their poverty.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>But their fortune changed a little, for one day a
strange chance befell. Anna had made a fire between
some stones in the yard of the cottage, and was cooking
a mixture in a pot when a ragged old man came up and
begged a taste of the soup. She looked at him and
thought how strange it was that anyone should beg of
her, and then she refused him, saying, “I am as poor
as you, good man, and my soup is bad, for it is what I
have myself gathered. I took my pot to the market
and begged. It is the first time, and it feels very
strange. Everyone knew I did not beg for money,
only for food. Some put in fruit, and some poured in
milk; others threw in biscuits; near the butchers’ line
I got a piece of meat, and by the vegetable stalls I
picked up some cabbage leaves and an old cucumber.
It is very well. I shall go every morning and we shall
not starve. Only the soup is for us and it will not be
good for others.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man was tall and very hairy; one could
scarcely see his face for hair, and through the rents of
his ragged red shirt one saw his brown hairy chest.
His overcoat was of many colours and many cloths;
he had evidently sewn into it whatever cloth he had
picked up during many wanderings, and he had lain in it
in many muds and soils, and the stains remained. His
legs were tied up in sacking like trees protected from
the winter, and his boots, which he had made himself
without leather, were little bags of wool and shavings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>and grasses and dandelion down. He was not, however,
the least self-ashamed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not reply to Anna’s refusal for some minutes,
but he stood watching, fumbling among his rags, and
she wished he would go away. But going away was
not part of his intention. He slowly brought out a
large iron spoon and, to the vexation of the woman,
knelt down on the ground and peered into the pot.
Then he gave his reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When Christ is near, water becomes wine;” and
with that he skimmed the simmering liquid and lifted
a spoonful to his mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s tasty,” said he; “awfully tasty—really
amazingly tasty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Anna smiled and answered simply, “I’m glad
you like it, grandfather.” Grandfather took another
spoonful and smacked his lips. “You know,” said he,
“this is something quite out of the way; it is very
original; I knew it was very good soup, it was speaking
so well. I heard its voice far away. It called to me,
it sang. What do you say to it, my dear, if I dine with
you to-night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Anna looked up at him appealingly. “No,” said
she, “pass by. We are very poor, and this is all we
have to eat; it is too poor for any guest. Dear old
man, go away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! I don’t think so. This sort of soup a
king would be glad to eat. It is the sort kings can’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>get. You might even make a great fortune if you sent
a sealed tin of this to the Tsar. The Tsar’s cook is a
great friend of mine; if you could get on the right side
of him you’d never want for a piece of meat to throw in
the soup. But I advise you, don’t part with the
recipe, it’s worth its weight in gold. And now, what
do you say to having me as a boarder? Yes, surely as
God rules over everything why shouldn’t I stay here?
How much shall I pay? Well, never mind, you make
this soup each day and then you can save all the
money.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Anna now felt seriously troubled. An old ragged
man could be no help to her; he could not pay her anything,
and she would be poorer than before. She
pinched up her pretty lips into a bunch, and frowned
and shook her head violently; it would never do.
“No, grandfather, I couldn’t take you; we are very
poor, and you are even poorer than we are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thereupon the old man laughed exuberantly, and
his eyes shone like those of Santa Claus.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know, I know, I know,” said he.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you know, grandfather?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man laughed again, and then pulled out a
large volume, old and rusty-leaved. It was a Bible,
and he opened it between the Old Testament and the
New, and there were money notes for seven hundred
roubles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s what,” said he. “My wages for clearing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>clouds out of the sky for the Sultan of Turkey—for you
twelve roubles a month, and you needn’t spend a penny
of it, for we shall live on such soup as this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Anna meekly bade him welcome, wondering who he
might be in disguise. Some great man, surely, she
thought, for he seemed very highly connected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is your name, grandfather?” said she, as he
stumped into her room and sat down on the box, and
took little Foma on one knee and Mania on the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is my name?” said he. “Ho, ho, ho,” and
he laughed. “That’s a good joke. It is a long, long
while since anyone asked me my name. I’ve heard so
many names; they were so like mine that I got confused
long ago, and it wasn’t worth while remembering.
What do you think, little Fomitchka? And you’ll be
asking where I come from. Really, I don’t know.
How many provinces are there in Russia? Thousands
surely. One day I slipped out of my own province and
lost myself, and I kept coming to new provinces, always
new names, and the places just looked the same. You
know it says in the Bible Adam was the first man; Mr
Adam, then came Mr Cain Adam and Mr Abel Adam,
and Mr Seth Adam. You call me Mr Adam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A-dam, grandpa,” said little Foma.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the ragged old man with the money and the
Bible and the spoon came and lived with them. They
all lived together, slept in the same room, and ate from
the same table. Every morning Anna went to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>market with her pot and collected food, and every
evening she boiled soup on the stones, whilst grandfather
dipped his finger or his spoon into the stew and tasted it
approvingly. Every Sunday she received three roubles
from him and put them by. It was strange; they lived
as poorly now as they had done before. So poorly they
lived that they only had tea once a week, and they
boiled it in a saucepan and had it without sugar. Grandfather
had produced a partly-used two-ounce packet of
tea from his overcoat. Yet this tea-party was something
glorious—a strange weekly happiness to be
anticipated even six days ahead. Anna ceased to feel
anxious, and the children grew rounder and happier,
though it was difficult to see how it had come to be.
They were being fed by something more than soup;
perhaps, as they scrambled about grandfather’s knees
and listened to his stories, they were enchanted a little.
Anna looked at them and wondered. Grandfather has
tramped through sun and rain, thought she—how dark
and rich his hands are, like the black earth in the
spring. Her little baby, that had done nothing but
scream and look unhappy since it was born, had now
begun to smile. It smiled at grandfather like a little
evening gleam of sunshine after wet, wet days.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lizetchka,” her mother would exclaim. “Ah,
Lizetchka! Little Lizetchka! My little angel!”
Then the neighbours came in and they would have found
fault and gossiped, but grandfather’s cheery way took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>their hearts by surprise. And the owner of the cottage,
who was responsible, wanted to turn the old man out
because he had no passport, and it was dangerous to
harbour such a man; but he, too, was won over;
though he was mean, and had a wife meaner than himself,
he contentedly took the risk. Sometimes his wife
would urge him on against Anna and the old man, and
he would go to them to say stern words; but when he
came and saw the children, with their little fingers
tangled in grandfather’s hair, he would forget his message
and laugh and say, “Ah, Mr Adam! Fancy you living
here without a passport! It’s all right living so, eh?”</p>

<p class='c013'>So time went on, and no one disturbed the little
<i>ménage</i> of Anna and her three children and Mr Adam.
Years passed, and the old man ceased to be a surprise;
nothing new happened; no one inquired after him;
no one claimed him. He lived all the while in his rags,
and read from his Bible, and played with the children,
and praised the soup, and made merry with the neighbours.
Only once Anna had been sad. That was when
she mended his torn red shirt for him. She had often
mended Peter’s clothes whilst he wore them on his body,
and now an irresistible memory brought back the
pathos of her loss. She wept a little and Adam comforted
her, and as she looked through her tears at him she
felt suddenly very grateful, and it seemed to her that
perhaps Peter had sent this man to her to help her.
Suddenly the thanks which had been mounting up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>her heart overflowed, and as she finished sewing she
put her arms round his neck and kissed him.</p>

<p class='c013'>The days of these years were strange days, the
strangest of Anna’s life, and in after years they seemed
only a few days, only a short, strange period of heavenly
comfort. For the time came when she had Adam no
more. He fell ill and died.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr Adam’s dead,” said all the neighbours, and they
felt very sad. “Mr Adam is dead,” said the owner’s
wife. “Now you’ll see how foolish it is to have a man
without a passport. What will the police say? You’ll
have to put his dead body in a field for men to find, and
then it will be said we murdered him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Grandpa dead,” said all the children and moped.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Anna felt very troubled. What was she to do
with him, a man without a name, without a family,
without a village? A man who had over five hundred
roubles in his Bible! Poor Anna! Had she but had a
little cunning she might have put by those five hundred
roubles to be a little fortune for herself. Grandfather
had died very suddenly or he would have told her to
do so. Anna was simple enough to go and tell the
police her story, and an official came, looked at the man,
and took away the Bible, saying he would have it examined.
In the Bible lay the precious notes! Then
Anna bought white robes and took off Adam’s rags,
and washed his body, and laid him upon some clean
boards, and bought a cheap coffin, and hired a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>to dig a grave, and she went and buried him, and put
a little Ikon on his breast, and held a lighted candle
over his tomb, and sang the thrice-holy hymn, “Holy,
holy, holy,” and went home. Adam was no more; they
were poor; the official never returned with the Bible;
no one asked about the missing passport. But what
the greedy official had not guessed, and what Adam had
never divulged, was that in his rags, in one of his many
deep pockets, was secreted another sum of money, a
thousand roubles. This Anna found, and was wiser
than before, having learnt from experience. To-day
she keeps a little cookshop and is prosperous, and the
peasants say that she, better than any of the wives of
the village, knows how to make good soup.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such was the story the tramp told me. He liked
telling it, and now, as I have repeated it, I find the same
personality in the friend of the woman and in my acquaintance.
Surely Adam did not really die. Adam
never really dies.</p>

<p class='c013'>One other thing he said to me that remains; there
are two Adams—the Adam before he tasted the fruit and
the Adam after he had tasted. Most Russians retain
their Eden happiness, but whenever one of them tastes
of the Tree of Knowledge his old happiness is cursed;
the time has come for him to leave Eden and seek the
new happiness. Adam was the first <i>modern</i> man. The
tramps have found the second Eden.</p>

  <h2 id='ch29' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />THE BAPTIST CHAPEL</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;HAVE continually come across Protestants in
Russia. They are undoubtedly increasing in
numbers very rapidly. Several times when I
was out in the mountains I came across proselytising
Baptists and Molokans. The Molokan is a
sect of Protestant exclusively Russian, I think. They
differ from orthodox peasants by their ethics. They
hold it a sin to smoke or to drink, and they do not
recognise the Ikons. Even in Lisitchansk there had
been a Baptist family, and in Moscow I had found
Lutherans.</p>

<p class='c013'>M. Stolypin’s ukase marked the decease of Pan-Slavism,
that policy summarised in the words—one Tsar,
one Tongue, one Church. It was comparatively little
noticed, this Emancipation Bill of Russia, but it will
probably prove a more important concession to the
forces of Democracy than any other fruit of the Revolutionary
struggle. It began a new era: historians
in the future will take it as a starting-point in the
history of Russian freedom. Meanwhile, despite
rumours to the contrary, Russia as a whole is as peaceful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>as Bedfordshire. The Revolutionary storm has passed
away; the new issues of life and death germinate in
silence. The flushed red fruit burst out, the seeds were
scattered. To-day the seeds gather strength and grow
and put forth shoots, and even the ordinary observer is
aware of the beginning of a crop whose nature is sufficiently
enigmatical. On another day there will be
another harvest. And if Elizabethan Puritans meant
ultimately the Whitehall gallows, one may ask apprehensively
for the significance of the Puritanism that is
springing into existence in the reign of Nicholas II.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was talking to the pastor one evening shortly
after I came.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We increase, brother,” said he to me, “we increase.
Three years ago there were only 120 of us and
now we are 300; in three more years we shall be half a
thousand, not less.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But is it not dangerous?” I said. “Surely you
come into conflict with the authorities.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not much now. Three of us were hanged two
years ago. And often meetings are forbidden. The
last Governor forbade our meetings altogether; that
was ten years ago. Many of us suffered through that;
some are in prison now and some died in prison. But
we held our meetings despite the ukase of the Governor.
We used to gather together at a friend’s house, and then
after tea we would have our few hymns and a prayer or
two. These meetings were generally very happy, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>common bond of danger made us closer than
brothers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you?” I asked. “Were you ever arrested?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, with four others one night; two of them died
in prison, they were old men and it was hard on them.
I served five years’ penal servitude. That was for holding
a meeting against the order.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The minister was silent as if recalling old memories,
and then suddenly he went on as if brushing aside his
thoughts. “But things are quieter now. In all Russia
there are twenty thousand Baptists alone, besides many
thousand other Protestants, and we are added to in
numbers every year. In Rostof a little congregation
has become three thousand since the Duma came in.
And now dotted all over the country we have little
missions among the peasants; it’s the peasants who’re
coming to us, and nobody else has been able to teach
them. Every year new missions start. Next month I
make my little country tour, when the harvesters are in
the fields, and I go to five new places—five places to
which the Gospel has come this year.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On the very first Sunday morning comes my host to
warn me not to be late for service. I prepared to go to
chapel seriously; it was long since I had been in any
place of worship other than a temple of the Orthodox
Church.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half a mile distant I found the building, the little
defiant, heterodox place so brave in its denial and protest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Here was no church, not even a chapel, just a
plain wooden building. This black, gaunt building,
less beautiful and less ornamented than a house. God
dwells in those jewelled, perfumed caskets of the
Orthodox Church; He dwells here also. How well and
how daringly the paradox had been asserted! And they
called it a meeting, not a service, and it was held upstairs
and not down; and instead of standing all through
one sat all through, and there were no crosses and no
ornaments and no collections, and the women sat on one
side while the men sat on the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>The room was large. Wooden forms ranged on each
side, there was a narrow passage down the middle, and at
the head of it stood the preacher’s platform, slightly
elevated from the people. The whole looked somewhat
like a chapel schoolroom.</p>

<p class='c013'>The congregation was in its way quite a grand one.
Not that it was by any means numerous; the little
place was full, one couldn’t say more than that. But
there wasn’t a woman dressed in anything finer than
printed cotton, and the minister was the only man who
wore a collar. Something in the people called out one’s
reverence. Each woman had a cotton shawl for head-dress,
and as the women’s side filled one looked along a
vista of shawled heads, and when now and then one of
them turned to look at a stranger one saw the broad-browed,
pale face of a peasant woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were all peasant folk, or working men or artisans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and very simple and earnest. One knew much of them
when one heard the words of their elected pastor. Ivan
Savelev, when he came in, walked directly to his place
and knelt, and then after a few minutes’ silence closed
his prayer by a few words spoken on behalf of the congregation—gentle,
simple words, such as a mother might
put into the mouth of her child. He is a tall, douce
man, the minister, of a Scottish type of countenance.
His calm face and eyes suggest an infinite reserve of
wisdom, and his gentle, musical voice tells of a mind and
will in harmony. Presently he read from the Bible,
and then gave out a hymn, and afterwards spoke from a
text, first to the women, then to the men, and then to
both collectively, and then gave out another hymn.
What struck me was that he did each thing as if it were
worth while, so that the numbers of the hymns sounded
beautifully.</p>

<p class='c013'>The people sang with a will and kept in tune. The
pastor, after giving out the number, stepped over to the
harmonium and played a tune. He is choir-master as
well as preacher, and teaches his people new tunes from
two books of his own—<i>Hymns, Ancient and Modern</i>,
and an old copy of <i>Moody and Sankey</i>; priceless
treasures, one would say, though the printed English
words remain inscrutable. We went off to the tune of
“See the conquering hero comes,” the Russian words
seeming very irrelevant. When the tune was in full
swing one really felt oneself back in England—old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>memories crowded to my mind. Just before the sermon
there was another hymn, and this to the tune of “Oh,
God, our help in ages past;” but a presto motif, and a
quaint alteration in the phrasing of the tune, reminded
one of peals of church bells. They sang it as if the lines
ran:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, God, our help in ages past our</div>
      <div class='line'>Hope for years to come.</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Shelter from the stormy blast and</div>
      <div class='line'>Our Eternal home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The pastor’s sermon was direct; to him the issue
was clear. Not alone those who say “<i>Gospody,
Gospody</i>,” but those who do the will of my Father shall
enter into the Kingdom. He counselled them to lead
earnest, sober lives, and to bring up their families in the
truth. Everyone listened in resolute stillness. One
felt their God in the midst of them—the God of the
Puritans.</p>

<p class='c013'>I found my thoughts straying back to England, and
I wondered if I saw before me a picture of what the
early Independents or early Methodists were like. I
was accustomed to chapels in London where each
person belongs to our advanced civilisation, and where
the preacher hands more than the simple bread of life.
Here each man was of the crude, rough material out of
which civilisations are made. Here was a passion for
simplicity; everything was elemental, original. There
were strange, new silences to be divined below the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>voices and the sounds, strange barenesses and nakednesses
underneath the scanty nature of the service.
For a moment one shut one’s eyes to the room, and
opened other eyes to another scene—to the stable and
the manger and the straw. Yes, here were the beginnings
of things.</p>

<p class='c013'>After service I walked home with the pastor. “You
will become a political force,” I said. “Who knows?”
he replied. “I hope not, but we increase in numbers.
Everyone added to us is one added to the forces of truth
and purity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some pilgrims passed us. “There they go,” he said,
“hundred of miles to pray to God in an ancient monastery.
God is there, He is not here, so they say. They
go to pray, and they waste their money and their time,
and it all ends in vodka drinking. God grant they may
become less and less.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The pilgrims retreated, staff in hand, hooded and
with great bundles on their backs. Slowly, as it were,
reluctantly, they moved away, and to me they seemed
the living figure of the past, and this fresh, strong man
beside me was the new.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are laying the foundation of a Russian
democracy,” I went on. “In England or America you
would see a democracy three hundred years ahead of this.
Have you heard of the London slums, or of Chicago?
Are you not afraid of the responsibility?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He smiled. “Three hundred years is a long time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>brother. We teach the truth. If your people have
gone wrong it was because they turned away, they took
wrong turnings. It is God’s will that we preach and
spread the truth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ivan Savelev carried himself with the air of one who
had uttered an unquestionable truism. His truths
were his own, and for him indisputable. I left him
and went to meditate on the secret life I had discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>It moves silently and unseen, like running water
under snow, and on countless hillsides and valleys and
plains the spring movement has begun. One day
Russia will awake and find the season new. Then
there will come another autumn and another harvest,
and the good seed will be found to have multiplied
thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and some an hundredfold.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>ONE day, when I was visiting a village on the
steppes, I came upon a strange comedy
very typical of Russian life. I went in to
a bootmaker to get one of my boots sewn
up, and I overheard the following conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marya Petrovna has seen the Anti-Christ,” says
the cobbler’s wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” says Jeremy, her husband, “it is God who
has looked on her. God has been very pleased with
Masha.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” rejoins his wife, “she seems very holy, but
I don’t like it. Last Sunday at church she knelt so
long that everyone thought she had fallen asleep.
When the priest opened the door of the church she went
in and knelt down on the stones before the blessed Ikon.
All through the service she kneeled, and all through the
Communion, and though she had bought her loaf and
the priest called her she did not go up to the altar, but
simply went on kneeling. Then, when the bells rang
and we all went out, she still remained kneeling. And
she didn’t cross herself. The priest himself had to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and lift her out of the church so that he could lock
up. I think she’s under a curse. She has done
some dreadful sin—has talked with wood spirits,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Squire’s son came on the Devil’s hoof marks
in the forest last week, and saw a man with eight dead
foxes shortly afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The cobbler’s wife held up her hands with horror.</p>

<p class='c013'>Katusha, a young woman from a neighbouring izba,
has come in.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You speak of Marya Petrovna,” says she. “We
saw her last night, Tanya, Lida and I and a lot of us
looking through the window. She was kneeling on her
knees and praying to the samovar and calling it God.
The priest went in and tried to talk with her, and he
tried to raise her, but it was difficult, so he picked up the
samovar instead and hid it away. Then poor Masha
stood up, and we saw her look at the big black pot
that has the cabbage soup in it, and she crossed herself
as if it were an Ikon. Two days, they say, she hasn’t
eaten, and Peter, her husband, has had to get his meals
himself. She won’t do anything in the house, and
directly she sees something new she goes down on her
knees to it. The priest has been reasoning with her,
and she says she sees God everywhere. God is everywhere,
that is true, but Masha says He’s in the pots
and pans and in the stove, and she won’t sit on a chair
because she says it’s all God. You should have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>her last night, she looked a holy saint, and her eyes were
full of light.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord save us!” exclaimed the cobbler’s wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Permit me to go on. Her eyes were full of light,
and she lifted up her hands to the roof, and sang strange
music, so that we all felt terrified, and the priest wept.
When we saw the priest weeping we didn’t know what
to think, and presently he and Peter came and told us
to go home, and that Marya Petrovna had had a vision—God
had been so good to her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The cobbler looked very solemnly at her for some
minutes, and then turned his gaze upon his wife. “I
think,” said he, “that it may be that this is the second
coming of Christ.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Idiot!” exclaimed his wife. “How could Masha
be Christ?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t mean Masha,” he replied, “but perhaps she
sees Him coming. He may be getting nearer and nearer
every moment, and Masha may see the glory brighter
and brighter. Masha always was our most religious.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this point the grocer’s wife, in a red petticoat and
a jacket and a shawl, rushed in, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just think, friends, Marya Petrovna is dead! I
am absolutely the first person to give the news, I had it
from the priest just as he left the house. He watched
with her all night—but pardon me, I must be going.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that she rushed out to be the first to give the
news to the rest of the village.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>The cobbler and his wife exclaimed together,
“Bozhe moï! Oh, Lord!” And Katusha slipped
out after the grocer’s wife, intending evidently to have
her share in the glory of gossip. The cobbler threw
aside his last, and went out as he was, in his apron and
without his hat, and his wife went with him. They
swelled the little crowd that was already collected outside
Masha’s dwelling.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was indeed as the grocer’s wife had indicated.
Marya Petrovna had died. Of what she had died
everyone could say something. Some peasants ascribed
it to the Devil and some to God. The majority
held that God had taken her to heaven. The priest’s
explanation was that the woman’s life had been very
acceptable to God, and that He had blessed her with a
vision of His glory. The vision had been a promise;
it had perhaps shown her her glorious place in heaven.
The vision of God had entered her eyes, so that she could
not put it aside and look at the ordinary things of life.
She could not see a samovar—she saw God. She
couldn’t make tea with the samovar; that would have
been sacrilege. She could not eat soup, she couldn’t
sit down, she couldn’t lie down, she couldn’t touch
anything. To do these things was sacrilege. So she
died. She died from utter exhaustion and from starvation.
No doubt God had taken this means to bring her
from the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such was the story that the priest communicated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>his superiors and to St Petersburg, hoping that it might
perhaps be thought fit to honour the mortal memory of
this new Mary whom the Lord had honoured. No
canonisation, however, followed, though to the inhabitants
of the village of Celo the woman remains a saint
and a wonder, and the moujiks cross themselves as they
pass the cottage where she used to live.</p>

  <h2 id='ch31' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br />ALI PASHA</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>THE Persian nation, which numbers seven or
eight millions of dwellers on its own soil,
has many thousands scattered over the rich
valleys of the Caucasus. In Tiflis, in Baku,
Batum, Kutais, the Persian, clad in vermilion or crimson
or slate-blue, is a familiar figure in the streets. Their
wares, their inlaid guns and swords and belts, their
rugs and cloaks, are the glory of all the bazaars of Trans-Caucasia.
One’s eye rests with pleasure on their
leisurely movements, their gentle forms and open,
courteous gait; and they give an atmosphere of peace
and serenity to streets where otherwise the knives of
hillmen, and the sullen accoutrements of Cossacks, would
continually impress one with the notion of impending
storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ali Pasha, or, as his friends familiarly call him, Ali
Khan, is one of this gentle, harassed nation, a native of
Ararat, having been brought up within the shadow of
that awful mountain upon which, it is said, the Ark first
grounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had my first talk with him one evening shortly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>after I came to the mill. It was a Saturday night, and
the pastor’s family were preparing for the Sabbath by
holding a prayer-meeting round the samovar. The
other neighbours were skulking round the window listening
to the hymn-singing, so we were left to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in the shade of evening. He was having his
tea at his ease—crimson tea, coloured by infusion of
cranberry syrup. I was sitting near by, writing a letter
to England. He looked over with some interest, and
presently came and stood over me, regarding my fountain
pen and English calligraphy with a mild curiosity.
I gave him the pen to examine, he handled it carefully,
and, having eyed it over with naïve amazement, returned
it in silence. He volunteered to show me
Persian writing, and presently brought forth from his
dwelling two volumes of prayers written in what was
evidently Persian copper-plate, and by his own hand.
Each word, though symmetrical in itself, looked like a
pen-and-ink sketch of a wood on fire in a wind. Yet it
was very beautiful and reminiscent of nothing so much
as of an old Bible copied before the days of printing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ali Khan had purple beard and hair—his head looks
as if it had been soaked in black-currant juice. His
face is smoky, his eyes grey, benignant. He wears a
slate-blue cloak, golden stockings, and loose slippers;
he is slender, and stands some five feet ten above the
ground. His finger nails and the palms of his hands are
carmined.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>He had never met an Englishman before, and eyed
me somewhat incredulously when I said I came from
London. “The English are a wonderful people,” he
remarked. “Their ships call at all the ports of the
world, the armies of the great Queen are more countless
than the stars of heaven.” I explained that the Queen
was dead, and that we had a King now, but the Persian’s
interests seemed to be little in foreign affairs, and he
was all eager to tell me of his prayers and fasts. No,
he was not a Babi, but a pure Mahommedan. There
were sects of Mahommedans, just as many as there were
Christian sects. His church was up on the hill, the one
with the crescent moons on the spires. Soon a big
fast would commence, and he must eat no food during
seventeen hours each day.</p>

<p class='c013'>I ventured to pronounce the words “Omar Khayyám.”
He smiled, but did not seem surprised that I had
heard of him. “Our Omar.” Yes, he read Omar.
“And do your people read Omar much?” I asked.
“It is in vain,” he replied; “my people are very
wretched, few can read, and few care to. It is noble to
be on horseback fighting with the Russians, or against
the Russians. No; boys used to go to school, but now
they run wild, for there is such disorder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A sort of sweet melancholy came over his face, and I
asked him how he came to be an exile from his country.
“It is not a bad country to be exiled from,” he began.
“It would have been in vain if I had remained there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Ali Mamedof wrote to me to come here, that there were
many of my countrymen here, and there were plenty
who wanted coats. So I came by the train to Tiflis,
and then in a wagon through the mountain passes.”
He told me how he was taught in a little Persian school
in Ararat, that when he was twelve years old he had left
school and taken a hand in his father’s workshop and
helped to weave Persian rugs. I pictured the large
open doorway of the booth, the two at work squatting
on carpet stools before the high bamboo frame on which
the thing of wonder was being wrought, the peacock in
it, the half-finished peacock perhaps, with gigantic
tail, coming into being among living crimsons and
lambent blues, brilliant scarlets and lurid yellows.</p>

<p class='c013'>His father had been taken off by typhus before the
youngster had experience enough to be able to carry on
the business by himself; the mother had died long since,
so Ali was left an orphan. He got work from a tailor,
and sat in a little room with him, and worked all day
with assiduity not less than that of the sweated journeyman
of England. But things mended, and Ali Khan got
orders of his own, and bought his own Singer sewing-machine
and his own cloth and black sheepskin, and
then in a little wooden room of his own squatted on
his own carpet, and lived in independence many a
happy year.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the Russians had come. They built their railway
even right alongside the sacred mountain, and connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Ararat with Tiflis and Batum and Baku, and,
indeed, with all the North. Rugs and swords went to
Tiflis by train instead of by camel, and ready-made
trousers and cast-off clothes came back in exchange.
Then with the ready-made trousers came the Russian
trader, and the almost ubiquitous German commercial
traveller. Russians and Caucasians came in, and
Russian officials and Cossacks, Russian police and passports.
Ali’s trade grew bad. His Russian customers
were hard to please, the prospect of war and massacre was
what all the natives talked of, and many of his friends
and customers had been called away to fight at Tabriz
and Teheran. Ali Khan had looked despairingly at
the future. Then Ali Mamedof had written, and he had
taken his advice.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came and settled up in this territory, indubitably
Russian, though on the mountains, and found to his
surprise some thousands of his countrymen there.
“Would you not rather be in Persia?” I asked. “Oh,
no,” he rejoined. “There is no security there, and
there is no money there. Ours is a poor country, and is
full of enemies. Here is much custom. I shall grow
rich, and perhaps afterwards, when things are quieter,
I shall return to Ararat, to spend my old age there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And the Shah?” I asked. “Oh, they’ve caught
him,” he replied. “He’ll come and live in the Caucasus
also. It is much better for him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this point he began to put his samovar up. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>was nearing the daily prayer time. He went leisurely
into his dwelling again and shut the windows, and passed
into his inner room, where a square carpet lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently I heard the faint sound of his voice. I
pictured him, as he was no doubt, kneeling on his
carpet, praying in the words of his hand-written volumes
to the one God—praying for the time of peace for Persia,
and for all the world, and at the same time resigned and
gentle before the Eternal Will.</p>

<p class='c013'>So my acquaintance began with Ali Pasha. I think
he was a noble man, and by far the most refined and
courteous of the dwellers at the mill. I might almost
add, though it would sound paradoxical, he was the
most Christian. Nowadays surely all men are Christian,
even Mahommedans, Buddhists and Confucians. It is
only the name that they lack, the same religion is in all
of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a woman near by who worked at a
brewery and worked very hard, although she drank too
much. Alimka and Fatima were her children, and they
were so starved that they would rob the chickens of the
waste food thrown in the yard. I noticed that Ali lent
the woman money and helped her with the children.
And when a Punch and Judy show came into the yard
Ali subscribed more generously than anyone else so that
the children might have a treat. And when I took
little Jason under my care Ali backed me up. He even
tried to rescue another bird and pass it on to me.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>But he was very punctilious in the performance of
the services of his own religion. Special praying men
came in to pray for him at different times during the
summer, and their loud keening sounded in my ears long
after I had gone to bed. Then when the Feast of
Ramazan came he lived the life of a hermit.</p>

  <h2 id='ch32' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXXII<br /> <br />THE SORROWING MAN</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>A&nbsp;WOMAN in Vladikavkaz, being told she
could not live long, grew so much in love
with the idea of death that she ordered
her coffin in advance, and lay in it in her
bedroom and had a mock funeral, just to see what it felt
like. That was an incident rather typical of the life of
the <i>intelligentia</i> of the place. There are many nerveless,
sad, despairing people there, people with no apparent
means of happiness, people of morbid imagination and
a will to be unhappy. All around them Nature has
outdone herself with seductive charm; the sun flashes
on the mountains, the myriad flowers smile in the
valleys, the happy peasantry flood the town with jovial,
laughing faces, but all in vain. “The fact is,” as I said
to Ivan Savilief, “Adam was only the first modern
man; the peasants are still living in their Edens. All
your modern Adam and Eves have got to get saved
somehow.” The Baptist, who, it must be remembered,
was still a peasant, and by no means one of the
educated classes, was very happy. And his notion was
that the sad people needed to believe; they needed faith.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>They got as near to happiness as it was possible for them.
They got as far as feet could carry them, but for the
last gulf they needed wings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is a story of a Russian man, one who failed to
accomplish his happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>A certain man had great possessions and great happiness.
He had inherited broad lands and gold; he was
young and strong and able to enjoy riches; and he had
friends and the good opinion of the world. The cup
of his happiness was broad and deep and brimming.
Behold what happened to him; there came a time
when he achieved the summit of earthly bliss, and then
suddenly he lost all and became a man of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was a good man. He had kept the laws of God
and of man; no one could reproach him. His mind was
young and fresh and open to the influences of beauty.
His heart and mind were in communion. God looked
upon him and smiled, and then suddenly there came
a time when, as it were, God turned away His face.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is the story of the change. The man’s life,
with its wealth and its adornment, its pillars and its
towers, its sumptuous chambers and domes of pleasure
was as a precious palace just completed. Within the
hall the glories of his youth lay, the crowns and the
laurels, the shields and the swords. They were cast
there, and upon all there was erected a throne. And
then the most beautiful maiden his world could give
was seated upon the throne. The palace as perfection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>throbbed—dared to exist. The young man realised for
a minute the dizziest heights of happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>But on his marriage eve he fell.</p>

<p class='c013'>It had been a saying of his boyhood that the condition
of happiness is that one follow unfalteringly one’s
highest hope. It had always seemed to him that Hope
must go on before, that however happy one became
there would always be the prospect of further happiness,
that one never could catch up hope. And now, behold,
he stood <i>at one</i> with his ideal, and he felt that earth had
no more to give.</p>

<p class='c013'>On his marriage eve he communed with his heart,
and having given thanks to God, as was his wont, he
fell into a trance. For a space time ceased to exist for
him, whilst his soul was borne away from him to unknown
powers. When he awoke he was changed. The
trouble and doubt that excess of joy had brought him
had given way to a sort of exaltation. His light blue
eyes were gentle, as if they had looked long upon the
soft plumage of wings, and there was a strange radiance
within them. It was the light of inspiration, the
gleam of the knowledge of God. He walked as one
might, having news of a great deliverance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The condition of happiness is that one follow unfalteringly
one’s highest hope,” said he. “And when
one comes level with one’s highest hope, God will destroy
the old hope and give a new one. There is a dark
moment at the summit of one’s mountain, and then suddenly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>when the last inch upward is achieved, God gives
His perfect revelation. The old cup of happiness is
dashed to pieces on the rocks when one sees the
Grail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It had come to the knowledge of the man that a
greater joy than that afforded by earthly things was
possible. He dimly apprehended the coming of a new
fortune, of a new opportunity. Some voice within him
seemed to cry, “Behold <i>the</i> opportunity comes; the
white horse comes riding past your gate; jump on it
and ride away! Something comes for which this
present happiness is only a preparation. There comes
an adventure worth your sword, and a true bride for
your heart. There is a narrow portal to be reached,
and now, even now, riseth the tide which takes you
there. Only once in a lifetime comes the tide that lifts
you and puts you on the high seas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c013'>He knelt and communed With his heart. He tried
to understand the Voice which spoke to him. He
composed his fluttering spirit, and then prayed to God.
He prayed, “What must I do, oh, God, to win eternal
joy?” He prayed and waited, and his soul grew calm
as a broad lake at eve. There came no answer to his
prayer, but whilst he waited he became conscious of a
new power. The deep silence of the world seemed to
have congealed, and before him stood a great grey
door.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“For each man there is a door to happiness,” said
the voice in his heart; “the door is shut, but the key
is in the door.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, the key is in the door,” said he. “I could
not have seen the key had I not power to open.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly, in the calm of his heart, the young man
willed to behold God and to attain supreme joy, and
he knew that the Vision would be vouchsafed to him.
But just as he was about to see that which he desired to
behold, the Devil, in the shape of a crow, flew across the
sky of his soul and alighted in his heart. The lake at
eve was ruffled, and a whisper like a cold night breeze
from the east sped along the surface of it and said,
“You will find the true bride for your heart, but does
not that mean you must renounce this earthly beauty
who has just crowned the happiness of your youth?
You will become as a little child and begin life again,
and forego all the honour that your years and wealth
have brought you. If you see God once, nothing less
than God will ever satisfy you, and your eyes, having
looked on that radiance, will find the world intolerably
grey.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then a great terror sprang up in him like two contrary
winds born together in a wood, and it shook his
spirit. His soul was stirred up from the bottom so
that it lost all its purity, and he prayed, “Oh, Lord, do
not show thyself lest nothing hereafter give me joy:
it is my will, take this cup from me.” The prayer was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>heard, and the white robe of his transfiguration was
caught up into the heavens again.</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw not the Vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw not the Vision, but since that day he cannot
be satisfied by anything other than it.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it happened that on his marriage eve he fell from
the dizzy heights of happiness and became a man of
sorrow. He passed, as it were, out of the favour of
God. His estate decayed a little, but even the great
wealth which remained was but barren gold. His mind
and body grew infirm. With his bride he had no happiness.
He lost the good opinion of the world, and those
who once were friends pointed at him and said, “There
goes a failure, a man not yet of middle age, but disillusioned
and crusty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The man is now spending the rest of his days and he
goes sadly indeed. No other opportunity has come,
and he knows in himself he will never be so near again.
He has become a lonely man, one who prefers his own
company, and likes to look upon the sky, or at the wild
things in the woods. He always appears as if he were
looking for something he has lost. His eyes are wistful
and sorrow—charged, his step heavy, his thoughts slow.
He comes nearest to happiness on cloudy days of
autumn when he attunes himself to Nature. Then he
has quiet moments and little pleasures, and accidentally
looking at some mouse or shrew scurrying among
the yellow leaves, he laughs to himself or smiles a little.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Then suddenly one might see him check himself as he
catches sight of the red October sun or some dark,
threatening cloud. He remembers his renunciation, his
supreme denial, and is again appalled. Conscience and
life will not let him forget, and he sees ever before him
the reverse side of the great silent door—the door
which is locked, but for which there is no key....</p>

<p class='c013'>The man searches, the man waits. He is like a
ghost that may not rest, until a mistake of the old has
been set right in the new. Men become his enemies.
He desperately hates the circumstances of life, the
things that made up his former happiness. The face
in the picture hates the frame which does not suit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Is it not all in vain! The lost opportunity never
returns; the tide never rises the second time; the White
Horse never comes past the gate again. “It is easier
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.” “With
man it is impossible, but with God all things are
possible.”</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>THE cost of living in the Caucasus is one-half
of what it is in the most thriving agricultural
district in Great Britain. This is because
Russia is a self-supporting empire; it
does not depend on other countries for its food supply.
I think the comparative economic positions of England
and Russia are inadequately known. In England the land
has been sacrificed to manufactures; by adopting Free
Trade it made a bargain with other countries in these
terms—that it would manufacture iron goods and cloth
in exchange for food. It gave up agriculture and it gave
up the country. It became a land of towns. The people
of the English towns <i>are</i> the English people. Russia,
on the other hand, remained an agricultural country,
and its manufactures have developed little. It is content
to take foreign manufactured goods in exchange for
its own superfluous food. The people of Russia are the
peasants; the Liberals in the towns don’t really count.
For town life and factory life democracy is most suitable,
and for country life conservatism and squiredom—for
English people democracy, for Russians autocracy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Those in England who have a strong wish to have
Russia democratised are also, strange to say, Free
Traders. Are they aware that if Russia becomes a
manufacturing country it will need its food for itself, and
will not need to buy our wares? Russia is really the
employer of England. What if England loses its job?</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The newspaper boom of the revolution has done
much harm; it has given English people a false idea of
Russia. That notion of Russia as a place of anarchists
and <i>gendarmes</i>, secret societies, spies, plots, prisons is ridiculous.
As after the Slaves War the Romans lined the
way home by poles on which the heads of the conquered
were fixed, so to the ordinary outsider appears the
boundary line of Russia—a palisade of heads on poles.
In truth, it is only fenced in by passport officers, unless
the outworks of lies in the European press must be
counted. Behind the fence, however, stands, not what
so many imagine—cossacks, cannon, prisons—but an
extraordinarily fertile, fruitful country, and a people
happy enough to be unaware of their happiness or unhappiness.
I have spoken to peasants from all parts of
the country, and I have not found one who had a word
to say against the Tsar, or who felt any grievance
against his country’s governors.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are a hundred millions of peasants who swear
by God and the Tsar, and who believe implicitly in
both God and Tsar, a hundred million strong, healthy
peasants, not yet taught to read or write, not yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>democratised and given a vote, not yet crammed to
death in manufacturing towns. These are Europe’s
unspent capital, her little store of unspoiled men set
against a rainy day, the solid wall between China and the
West.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was with these thoughts uppermost in my mind
that I came away from one of the July fairs at Vladikavkaz.
Such revelations of the bounty of Nature in the
abundance of food, and in strong limbs to be nourished
by it, I scarcely expect to see easily again. This fair
took place at one end of the great military road that
traverses the Caucasus, and connects Tiflis and the
Persian marches with Rostof and the North. In a
great open square, paved unevenly with cobbles, the
stalls are set up. At one end are five open forges,
where horses are strapped in and shod. Behind these,
about a hundred sheep and lambs struggle together,
whilst a shepherd milks the ewes into a bucket. At
another end of the “bazaar” there is a covered place
for cotton goods, and there the Georgian girl buys her
kerchief, and the peasant woman turns over all manner
of brilliant printed cotton. Between the sheep and the
drapery, for a full hundred yards, stand carts and
barrows, or, it may be, merely sacks and baskets, full of
cucumbers and tomatoes. The cucumbers are piled up
on the carts like loads of stones for road-making. The
vendors stand beside them and shout their prices. The
customers fumble about and pick out the best they can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>find of the stock. Behind or below the stalls the rotten
ones lie yellow and soft under the burning sun, and hens
come in and peck at them. Several thousand have to
be sold before afternoon; more than half will not be
disposed of before they are spoiled by the sun. Picture
the peasants outbidding one another, fat and perspiring
in the heat. Ten for three-halfpence is the highest
price, ten for a halfpenny the lowest. By two o’clock
in the afternoon one will be able to buy forty for a penny,
just to clear. Meanwhile children are dancing about,
eating them as one would bananas in England, munching
them as if they were large pears, and in a way that
would have brought bewilderment to the mind of Sairey
Gamp, who so clearly loved a “cowcumber.” A fortnight
ago a single cucumber cost twopence—assuredly
the tide has risen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarcely less in evidence than the luscious green of
cucumbers is the reposing yellow and scarlet of the
tomatoes—golden apples they call them. These also
must be disposed of; they go for a penny a pound, and
the baskets of many traffickers are adorned by the
purchase of them. Behind the cucumber row is the
potato market, where, for sixpence, you may buy two
stone of new potatoes. With these are a long array of
stalls with vegetables and fruit, everything super-abundant,
and at surprising prices. Raspberries and
apricots go at twopence a pound, peaches at fourpence,
cherries and plums at a penny, gooseberries at a halfpenny,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>blackberries at three-halfpence, and all this fruit
in at the same time. Strawberries came suddenly at the
beginning of June, and as suddenly disappeared; the
summer progresses at quick pace here. New-laid eggs
are sold at this fair at a farthing each, cheese at threepence
a pound, butter at tenpence, bacon at fourpence
and fivepence a pound. Herrings and river fish, sun-dried
and cured, are sold ten on a string for twopence
halfpenny; live green crayfish, ten for threepence.
At shops near by, mutton is sold at threepence halfpenny,
and lamb at fourpence halfpenny a pound; beef
at threepence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fair is, however, a poor people’s market. The
richer get their things at the shops, but it is difficult to
persuade a peasant to buy at a shop when he can get
what he wants at a fair. From time immemorial the
country people have met and bargained at fairs, so that
it is now in the blood. Hence it is that Russia is the
country of fairs, having as its greatest object of that kind
the fair of Nizhni Novgorod, that stupendous revival of
the old times. The difficulty of buying at a fair is no
obstacle; the crowds of people, the mountebanks
among them, the stalls without scales, the haphazard
bargains, and chance of bad money, are more alluring
than deterrent. Potatoes are sold by the pailful,
cucumbers by the ten, fish by the string, bacon and
cheese by the piece, and mutton mostly by the sheep.
One needs to be a connoisseur, a ready calculator and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>eye-measurer, if one is going to acquit oneself honourably
in the eyes of the fair bargain-drivers. No one
ever takes anything at the price offered; everyone
chaffers and bargains for at least five minutes before
settling yes or no. Then nothing bought is wrapped
up. One has to bring one’s own paper with one, or
one may buy earthenware pots or rush-baskets, and
put together the things that may touch without harm.
A pound of meat without paper puts the unprovided
purchaser in a dilemma. At the fair there is no dividing
line between tradesmen and buying people. Whoever
wishes may go and take his place, or he may take no
place, and simply hawk his things about through the
crowd. There are men hawking old clothes, old boots,
iced beer and ices. At ten o’clock in the morning the
scene is one of the utmost liveliness. Peasants are
standing round the ice-cream men and smacking their
lips; would-be purchasers of mutton are standing
among the sheep, weighing them and feeling them with
their hands in primitive fashion; at the back of the
forges meal and flour sellers, white from head to foot,
are shovelling their goods into the measures of gossips;
girls are raking over the cottons; the cucumber sellers
are shouting; and those who have finished their buying
are moving off with carts and barrows, sacks or baskets,
as the case may be, and not infrequently one may see a
man with a sack of potatoes in one hand and a fat sheep
under the other arm.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Later in the summer this became a Melon Fair, and
later still a Grape Fair. The melons were piled on the
ground and resembled heaps of cannon balls, reminding
me forcibly of the trophies of 1812 preserved in the
Kremlin at Moscow. There were acres of the large
melon, that one known as the <i>arbuse</i>, dark, swarthy
green without, blood crimson within. This is a national
fruit. It keeps well, and will be on every peasant’s
table at Christmas. The deacon at Lisitchansk ate
half a melon at every meal when I was there last
Christmas. In August they are as plentiful as apples,
and sell for a halfpenny or a farthing apiece. There
are so many of them that they overflow the towns and
the villages; one imagines them rolling away and filling
up all the ditches if a wind came in the night. Then their
colour is a delight, and it is very pleasant to see the
chubby children munching big red chunks of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wagons of grapes, cartloads of honey, in such terms
did the season express itself as it grew older. Grapes
were two pounds a penny, and honey threepence a
pound! And this also was the season of chilis, which
were bought in great quantities for pickling. Then
vegetable marrows and beetroots overflowed the plain—beetroots
too sweet for English palates. Tomatoes
were eventually sold by the bucketful. Peaches came
and were sold at a penny a pound, and apples at prices
that it seems absurd to mention. I said to Alimka one
morning, “Let’s buy twopennyworth of apples,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>we received so many that we had to return home and
empty our basket before we could make any more purchases.
I should only have bought a farthing’s worth.
Then a very interesting feature of the fairs were the
rosy cherry apples, no bigger than cherries, and very
hard, but making a jam that is beautiful and
delicious.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was pleasant to note the preparations for the
winter. Stores were being laid in which would not be
exhausted even in the spring. The miller was making
jam in the yard three times a week; even the Tatar
woman below, whom Ali befriends, was taking immense
stock of cheap fruit, boiling it for jam or <i>nalivka</i>, infusion
of fruit, or drying it for <i>compôte</i>. Even the
<i>koutia</i>, which will be eaten on Christmas Eve, was being
prepared now. In the yards of all the houses, in the
fields about the cottages, cooking and curing and pickling
was going forward. Brine was prepared for the
cucumbers and the fish, syrup for the jam—Russian
housewives always make their jam by preparing a syrup
first. Apples cut into squares, wild plums and apricots,
were drying on the roofs; chains of onions three yards
long, chains of dried mushrooms and baranka biscuits
were being hung up on the walls. All day one smelt the
savoury odours of food fresh cooked, all day one saw
little urchin children like Alimka and Fatima running
in and out of doors with tit-bits that they had stolen, or
that an indulgent mother had dealt out. The flies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>buzzed about the doors and windows as if in quest of
paradise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the picture of life in connection with the
fairs; the picture is somewhat inadequate, but I hope
it may serve to show the feeling there was of abundance.
It was an exhilarating element in the atmosphere, and
together with the impression of immense mountains and
deep wide skies allowed one to live in the large things of
life. And Russia is the land of a few large things as
opposed to England, a land of many small ones. No disparagement
to my native land! Russia is neither
greater nor less than England, but it is different.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c018'>1. <i>Bareback to Kobi</i></h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_7 c015'>I&nbsp;HAD given Nicholas an address, Poste Restante,
Mleti, and as Mleti is in the province of Tiflis,
on the other side of the mountains, it took
several days’ tramping to get there. I set off
one August morning. The following are pages from my
diary:</p>

<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Kobi</span>, <i>10th August</i>, 6 a.m.</div>

<p class='c022'>I am sitting on the stone wall of a bridge and am
spread to the sun. Last night I slept on a ledge of red
porphyry rock beside some moss and grasses; the dew
was very heavy and I felt cold. I don’t think I slept
much, but I feel pretty fit at this moment, sitting as I am
in the sun on this bridge. I got up at the first sign of
dawn and went to one of the inns of the village—each
village has several inns of a kind, half grocer’s shop and
half wine house—<i>dukhans</i> they call them. The samovar
was actually on the table steaming. Hot tea was
wonderful after such a cold night.</p>
<div id='i272'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i272.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>KAZBEK POSTING-STATION</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This village is six thousand feet up, and I should probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span> have slept at the posting-station, but I arrived
too late last night. So I slept out again as on the last
three nights. I had a very lively journey hither. I
left the Kazbek Station yesterday evening, and thought
to find a comfortable sleeping-place in the barley fields
that lay between the road and the River Terek; but just
as I was beginning my tramp an Ossetine came up with
four horses and asked would I care to ride one. It was a
bareback business, and I rather fought shy of it, but he
pointed out a quiet horse and assured me we should go
gently. We should need to go gently if I was going to
feel comfortable after eighteen versts of it. There were
of course neither stirrups nor saddle, and as I had a
blanket across my back I made a saddle of that. I felt
ridiculously stiff in the legs, for I had walked thirty
miles already, but I managed to scramble on to the
horse’s back. The Ossetine disengaged his horse from
the other three and rode separately. I had two horses at
my side. It was very uncomfortable riding, but I soon
learnt what to do; how to kick him if the horse went
too slow; how to cry <i>brrrrr</i> if I wanted him to stop.
But, oh! how sore I got. After five versts I began to
ride side-saddle. At six versts we stopped at a wineshop,
another <i>dukhan</i>; there are plenty of them along
the road. There is no Government monopoly of spirits
on this side of the Caucasus. They can’t enforce that
on a population that has produced its own wines for
centuries. I did not much want to stop but the Ossetine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>did. He was an unprofitable companion, for utter
stupidity he would be hard to be matched; he was
almost totally lacking in intelligence. He put on a
thoughtful look whenever he was addressed, and
answered something irrelevant. I do not think he
could understand any sentence in which the word wine
did not occur, hence his astonishing imbecility. His
face was reminiscent of the sun shining through a
shower of rain, eyes and moustache wet-looking, and
the latter yellow and shiny—in his eyes fore-knowledge
of wine—also remembrance of wine. A boy came out
of the <i>dukhan</i> and tied our horses to posts. The
Ossetine became very gay and festive, and directly he
got into the shop slapped the innkeeper on the back, and
ordered sixpennyworth of white wine, which meant a
bucketful. It had a look of the tea I have made from
the Terek when the river has been very muddy, and it
was a trifle fiery. I drank two glasses and the man had
the rest. When the bucket was dry he began to be
very sympathetic with me. I had only had two glasses;
what a pity there wasn’t any more. Shouldn’t we have
some red wine now? But I wasn’t going to buy him
any more wine, and I had a wish to get to Kobi in fairly
decent style, so I said, “No thanks, I don’t want any
more, but if you want another drink you order it;
don’t be shy on my account. I haven’t any more
money.” This conference had lasted some time; it
was getting darker; I did not want to arrive in Kobi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>after night-fall; it would then be difficult to find a soft
place to encamp for the night. But the host brought in
tea. This was free of charge, and so we sipped it, and
played with it, while the Ossetine tried to persuade me
to stand him another bucket of wine. He failed; we
went out. He was drunk before we dismounted, and
now he was at the fighting stage. He had separated
the horses differently at the inn, so that I was with one
only; and now, without a word of warning, he slashed
them from behind with a whip. We went off at a
gallop; he brought his two horses into line, and we went
forward neck to neck full pelt for two versts as if we
were a desperate cavalry charge. It was fearfully
thrilling! We came to a sudden halt at a turn of the
road in order to let a cart pass; we were all four horses,
all scrunched and cooped up in a corner. The Ossetine
swore by all his saints if he had any—he was a Mahommedan—for
my horse was backing into him, and kicking
out with its hind legs. Then suddenly we left the road
and cantered over the moor to the Terek. The river
was by no means so impetuous there as in the Dariel
Gorge, and we forded it. What a kicking and splashing
we made, and how the horses stumbled! I thought I
should have been pitched into the water. Of course I
got drenched to the knees as it was. After this I had
to dismount and put my rug straight, and the first
thing that happened after I got on again was most
startling—the flame, flash and bang of a revolver just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in front of me, and the Ossetine tearing off as if he were
possessed. I thought someone had shot at him,
especially as he signalled to me over his shoulder. I
kicked my steed, brought him along sharply and got
abreast of him. It was the Ossetine who had fired, and
two minutes later he fired again. The wild man was
brandishing his weapon and shouting in his own
language. Then he grinned at me, and said in Russian,
“No one’s going to touch me, eh?” I felt apprehension,
and took good care to keep behind him. I
did not want a bullet in my back. He continued to
flare about, and pull up his horse at unexpected moments,
and with such severity that it pawed the air. Presently,
whilst we were leading our horses down some
steep rocks amid a litter of stones, it seemed he fired at
me. I asked him to be careful and he grinned maliciously.
Then we re-forded the Terek and regained the
road, which was a relief, for there is less chance of being
murdered on the highway than among the rocks. The
Ossetine became very sulky; he had evidently been long
on the way and would be abused by his master when
he got to Kobi. No pace was quick enough for him;
I think if I had been thrown he would have left me by
the wayside and charged ahead full gallop with the four
horses. I was glad enough, therefore, when the lights
of Kobi appeared. I dismounted outside the village
and walked in. The wine and the tea and the gallop
made me feel more queer than a rough Channel passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>would have done. Then I wished I had some number
to write down, that would indicate how tired my legs
were of clasping that horse’s back.</p>

<p class='c013'>I slept on the hard rock, or did not sleep, and had
hot tea in the morning, and here I am. I shall take
things easily to-day.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is a beautiful place, a wide trough of black
earth high up among the mountains. It has an immense
sky for a mountain village, and the air is buoyant, fresh,
perfect. All around are rosy porphyry rocks, and like a
gleam in fairyland the sunlight comes upon them at
dawn. This is the village to have a cottage in; it is
perfectly beautiful and in the heart of the mountains,
and is at cross-roads. Only the flowers are few; perhaps
it stands too high. The water flowing under this
bridge is green and clear and cold. I have just washed
in it. What luxury! Within a stone’s throw is a rock
out of which gushes seltzer water with iron in solution.
According to the natives it cures everything, even the
pain that you feel when in the mountains you come
across the track of the devil.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>2. <i>Driving a Cart to Gudaour.</i></h3>

<div class='c026'><span class='sc'>Gudaour</span>, <i>10th August</i>.</div>

<p class='c013'>I have been feeling very saddle-sore, but to-day my
pains are too many and too various to describe. I came
over the pass on a cart this day, and was so jolted that
I felt in need of internal refitting. I had been lying by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the roadside at Kobi drinking in the sunshine; it was
perfectly blissful. I was determined not to walk to
Gudaour; it didn’t matter if I did spend a day in perfect
idleness. But at noon I was aware of a vehicle crawling
towards me up the road, and I thought I would ask a
place in it for my weary bones. It took half an hour to
come up, however, for the driver was fast asleep and the
horse was going at its own sweet will, <i>i.e.</i>, at about a
mile an hour. I woke the man. He was an Armenian,
a copper-coloured fellow with a black eye. When I
got in, he beat the horse furiously with a thick cudgel
for about half a verst distance, and then relapsed into
sleep. We went at a smart pace and then slowed down.
The horse kept looking backward all the time—it had no
blinkers—watching its master and the angle of his
cudgel. When the Armenian was fast asleep the horse
resumed its original speed of one mile an hour. And so,
laboriously, we climbed the ten versts to Krestovy,
the ridge of the pass. The scenery was extremely
beautiful and the air very cold and fresh. At Vladikavkaz
I expect there were 90 or 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
but here, in the shade, it was near freezing-point. The
avalanche snow lay in great quantities below us, bridging
the little rivers. Even now and then there was snow
on the road. But we were protected from snow slides
by covered ways at the most important points. The
chief feature of the landscape were the cascades.
Narrow silvery waterfalls dropped from ledge to ledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>of the red porphyry rock. They are the prettiest things
I have seen in the Caucasus, for these mountains are the
places of the sublime rather than of the charming.</p>

<p class='c013'>At six versts the Armenian collapsed backward into
the cart and then woke up. The horse immediately
changed speed to five miles an hour; these collapsings
had evidently happened before and been followed by
cudgel thumping. The driver now rubbed his eyes,
and then looked at me as if seeing me for the first time.
Then he seemed to recollect, asked me where I was going
to, and gave me the reins. I took the seat in front, for
he evidently wanted me to drive. He, for his part,
spread his sheepskin cloak in the cart, and snuggled himself
to go to sleep. His last words were, “Hit her hard,
she’s not a horse, she’s a devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At eight versts I looked behind and saw a strange
cloud coming from the north. It looked like a clenched
fist, and all the knuckles stood out hard with anger. I
took advice and thumped the horse a little. It would
not be pleasant to be caught in a storm. We got along
at a better pace, the horse squinting back at me to see
if I were going to sleep. It was amusing that it increased
or slackened its speed as I raised or lowered the stick.
It was scarcely necessary to touch the horse at all. I
felt I had something in common with the conductor of
an orchestra. It was a cunning horse, however, and
knew that I was not its master. At the highest point
of the road it stopped stock-still and refused to budge;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>my mild thumping had no effect. The wind had now
risen to a gale and the fist of cloud had become a wide
army of vapours. I got down and led the horse a little
way, and then hopped to my seat while the cart was in
motion. We went like this for half a verst, and then
the horse made a sudden dash off the road and settled
down to eat grass. More habits were displaying themselves.
I got him off after some trouble, and set him
going on the road again. This proceeding, which had
to be repeated every verst or so, reminded me of the
“Innocents Abroad” and the mules. When they
wished to change direction they had to dismount, lift
up the mules by the hind-quarters, and turn them to the
new angles. I expect the mules would then go on a good
way without stopping: my case was worse. In six
versts we should be at Gudaour and could take shelter,
but the rain would overtake us. The clouds were
pouring over the rocks and cliffs all about, and only far
away to the south spread the blue sky as yet not
covered. Suddenly the clouds came drifting over the
road; we were obliged to stop, and as they rolled over
us and the cart they seemed to turn to rain at a touch.
But we were only five minutes in the mist; we heard a
long roll of thunder, and suddenly, instead of cloud it was
hissing, stinging hail. The Armenian slept soundly,
and I wrapped myself in my blanket and urged the horse
forward. The road lay downhill and we moved
quickly towards Gudaour. In an hour we arrived there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>and the rain had stopped; the clouds had passed over our
heads and there was blue sky again. The sun shone.</p>

<p class='c013'>We stopped at an inn in the village, and, looking
down from there, could see the thunderstorm that had
left us raging in the valleys of Mleti and Ananaour. The
clouds were literally below us, and we saw the blue sky
above them. How brightly the sun shone! it stood
just beyond a little grassy summit where some sheep
were browsing; it seemed that if one were there one
could stretch out one’s hand and take it from its place.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Armenian had definitely wakened up now and
was preparing to have a good meal. The innkeeper
lit a wood fire on the stone floor of his dwelling and prepared
to do some cooking. We bargained for a chicken
between us. It would cost sixpence. The chicken
was already plucked, and the innkeeper threw it into
a pot that he had on the fire. Whilst we waited for it
to cook we had a bucket of red wine before us, and the
Armenian did himself justice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re an Englishman,” said he. “You ought to
know where there’s any war going on. Where’s there
any war, I say? Where’s there any war?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In Spain,” I suggested. “The Spanish are fighting
the Moors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never heard of it; there’s been a war here, you
know, in Persia, but Persians are weak fellows, and the
Russians are weak. Three Persians one Russian, three
Russians one Armenian. Loris Melikoff, eh? Did you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>ever hear of him? He was the greatest general the
Russians ever had, and he was an Armenian. The
richest man in the world is an Armenian. He lives in
London and keeps a flying machine. You are English,
why don’t you use a flying machine? What does the
sky look like in England? Is it full of machines? One
day I shall go there. Already I know some English,
<i>brodt, bootter</i>. The English are better than the Russians.
Fine machines they have. But they break down, oh,
they break down. I saw two yesterday that couldn’t
get on. How would you like to plough a mountain side
with one of your machines? You’d break down. But
a horse wouldn’t break down; a horse for me. Do you
know they wanted me to join the army, serve my time,
be drilled, learn to ride and shoot. I said to the
General, ‘The devil comes to me to learn to ride and
shoot, who’s going to give me lessons? No Russian.
I should think not. Why,’ I said, ‘you give me your
hat and I’ll put it on one of these mountain peaks so far
away that you can’t see it, far less fire at it, but I’ll take
a gun and shoot it off.’ He said, ‘We shall have to
have you all the same,’ but they wont. I’ll go to England
or America first. Don’t I wish there’d come a
war; we Armenians would throw off the Russians and
have our own king. Dirty, vodka-drinking Russians,
always begging or drinking. Directly a Russian finds
five copecks he runs as hard as he can to the public-house
and drinks vodka, and when he comes out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>shop, if he sees a rich man coming, he will stand at the
side of the road and say ‘Give me five copecks.’ Shameless
people!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The arrival of the chicken cut short this harangue,
of which I have only remembered a little. He turned
out to be a wonderful conversationalist, this little man,
who seemed to be without words altogether when we
were in the cart. The chicken was tender. It was
served to us without knives and forks and on one plate;
we each took bones and picked them like heathens;
with the chicken there were pickled gherkins and white
bread and home-made cheese. The samovar appeared
and we had tea.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>3. Mleti.</h3>

<div class='c026'><span class='sc'>Mleti.</span></div>
<p class='c013'>I slept under a rock last night. A large boulder had
fallen on three other rocks and made a little cavern.
One had to let oneself in very gingerly, for the opening
was so small. It felt like sliding into a letter-box to
sleep. But the bottom was soft sand and the place
was secure from men and from rain. I was soaked
through; my blanket weighed at least a hundred-weight
with the water that was in it. But I slept.
This morning I have been drying myself. My blanket
is open wide to the sun and is steaming. I have taken
my coat off, and it also is lying on a rock getting dried.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>MLETI</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>By road to Mleti it is eighteen versts; cross-country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>it is only five. I came across country accordingly.
But it is a very difficult matter, Mleti being 2500 feet
lower. The road zig-zags extraordinarily, and I crossed
it six times before getting to this valley.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mleti is verdant. It is pleasant to get into a land of
leaves and flowers after two days among the desolate,
barren passes. And there is no river. Consequently
there is extraordinarily stillness and peace. It is the
first time I have been out of hearing of a river since I
have been in the Caucasus. I am sitting on a bank
where sweet-scented violets are growing; the air is
filled with their perfume. There are hollyhocks on the
slopes, hundreds and thousands of them, some over six
feet high, and covered with saffron-coloured blossoms.
I came through some weeds so high that they closed
above my head and shut out the sky, a waste of dead
nettle, comfrey, teasel, canterbury bells and convolvulus.
Clusters of pink mallow hung like bouquet-baskets
from these tangles. On the rocks there is an
abundance of stone-crop and bryony and pinks which
look like sweet-williams. The rock-roses are perfect
gems. High up, near Gudaour, I found several plants
which could not have been other than tradescantia,
which is not supposed to grow wild out of Asia. But
there is no end to the wild flowers of the Caucasus, and
plants brought up with tender care in England grow
brightly and abundantly without any care at all on these
wildernesses.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>There were three letters from Nicholas; he has saved
up money and thinks of going to London again. They
are highly characteristic letters, full of poetry. The
first one begins, “And someone has moved a stone with
his accursed hand,” which sounds very tragical in the
Russian of Lermontof. It means, I think, that Fate
has separated two friends who ought never to have been
put asunder. Later on in his letter he writes, “For you
the road to happiness lies open, for me it is closed for
ever.” This sentence reminded me of the day when
he plastered up the mirror with newspaper so that he
shouldn’t see his face. He proposes that I come to
Lisitchansk in the autumn, and that we return from
there to London. “Couldn’t I go, if only for a month?”</p>

  <h2 id='epi' class='c007'>EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_65 c015'>ON my way back I found a cottage at Kobi
for next summer. It is made of stone and
has two rooms. A sparkling rivulet comes
past, washing, as it were, the toes of the
cottage. It will be empty if I come and claim it in the
spring, and I think I shall. Now my summer draws to
a close. Already the procession of autumn has commenced:
the trees at the summits of the mountains
have turned from green to golden. The messenger
has come to Proserpine. Presently, where I used to
count five snowy peaks, I shall find seven and then ten,
till at last the little Sphinx mountain that squats outside
Vladikavkaz will also be a peak and glisten like the
rest. The thorn-apples have already burst and thrown
out their crimson seed, and like dusty yellow balls the
Cape gooseberries have appeared on the mountains.
The glories of gold and brown have spread downwards
like fire into the valleys. The leaves are falling from the
trees on the hills where the wind roars, from the trees
in the valleys, even from the trees in the town, where
there is no wind at all, and the snow is descending in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>valleys. The sleet falls in Vladikavkaz, and then snow,
and then in November even Vladikavkaz is, as Moscow
and St Petersburg and the whole wintry north, a snow-clad
town. The cycle of seasons has gone round;
winter turned to slush on Palm Sunday at Moscow, it
changed to laughing spring on the hill-slopes at Vladikavkaz.
Summer followed the plough over the fields
and blushed in a myriad flowers. The maize fields
waved, the sunflowers gazed. Then autumn was seen
in the streets, whilst all the village folk threshed the
corn with flails. The priest blessed the first fruits and
autumn was past. Once more it became the turn of
winter, the most Russian of all seasons. Quick pace
the winter came just as it had passed away. As in the
spring sledges gave way to wheels in a day, so now did
the wheels give way and the sledge ruled the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>A wave of intense longing came and I must see
England again. So one day found me once more in the
city of fog and rain. As I walked down Fleet Street in
Russian attire I heard someone say, “There goes a
Pole.” But when I came into the city people were not
deceived, and despite my shabby soft black hat, unclipped
hair, and furry overcoat, a young man in Throgmorton
Street persisted in whistling behind me that
Gilbert and Sullivan air:—</p>

      <div class='line in1'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>But in spite of all temptati-on</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Yes, he was.</p>
<p class='c013'>The time comes to draw a line and strike a balance,
and that is not an easy thing to do. Life to me has
meant love, and, as Antony says, “there’s beggary in
love that can be measured.” My gains are not to be set
down. Many things are true until they are set down in
words. A pressed flower is not a flower at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>I went to Russia to see the world, to see new life, to
breathe in new life. In truth it was like escaping from
a prison, and now when I take a walk in London streets
it seems as if I am taking the regulation exercise in a
prison yard. And the dirty rags of London sky look
like a tramp’s washing spread on the roots to dry.
Still, it is given that we live even in prisons and under
such skies for certain purposes. The towns have their
beauties and mysteries even as the mountains have. I,
least of all, have reason to be despondent there, for, like
the companion of Christian, I have in my bosom that
key which is called Promise.</p>

<p class='c013'>At my room in the mill at Vladikavkaz I commonly
looked out upon three pictures. In the foreground
was a row of trembling poplars, and beyond these was
a beautiful soft green hill, and beyond all a great grey
mystic range of mountains. I call them the Present,
the Future and the Eternal. The pleasant waving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>poplars were very real, very clear, and every leaf stood
out distinctly, but on the green hill the trees were so
many that I could not pick one out and see it clearly.
It tempted me to go there and explore. The hill was
full of allurement and charm, as it were, of the deep
eyes of a woman as yet unknown but destined to be
loved. It betrayed a mystery which it did not reveal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, the green hill seemed to be the best standing
place for looking into that vision of the eternal, of
the ever-present mystery of Man and his Life. The
mountains seemed to be the Ikon in God’s open-air room,
His vast chamber of Nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here then is the story of my life and of its gains
written in the terms of these symbols. It was written
at the Mill, it is a flower wreath gathered on the mountains.</p>
<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Horizon</span></h3>

<p class='c017'>A youth steps forward on the road and a horizon goes
forward. Sometimes slowly the horizon moves, sometimes
in leaps and bounds. Slowly while mountains are
approached, or when cities and markets crowd the skies
to heaven, but suddenly and instantaneously when
summits are achieved or when the outskirts dust of
town or fair is passed. One day, at a highest point on
that road of his, a view will be disclosed and lie before
him—the furthest and most magical glance into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Future. Away, away in the far-distant grey will lie
his newest and last horizon, in a place more fantastic
and mystical than the dissolving city, which the eye
builds out of sunset clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time was when the youth played carelessly in a
meadow and knew not of the upward road and mountainous
track. The destiny which was his had spoken
not from bee or flower; and if it came to him, came only
as a dream-whisper in the soft breeze that now and then
fluttered in his ears. The sun was then his, the blue
sky and the field below, and flower and leaf and tree and
the glad air. As these belonged to him, so he also belonged
to them, and neither knew nor cared of the having
or the losing. Life was joy, and joy was life. But
mornings pass, and every noon is a turning-point. One
afternoon found him wending from the meadow and
bending steps towards a green slope that lay before him,
cool and fresh and tempting. By a foot-path over the
hill he went to the great high road. The grasses waved
farewell to him as the evening breeze ruffled them in the
sunlight. The green slope parted with him, and he left
its sunlight and freshness, and his eyes looked on the
road. What was there in the road that he should
leave the hill for her—that he should take its dust for
her? He knew not, neither questioned he, but moved
ahead towards the highway which stretched out over
the undulating plain far up into the west; towards the
highway which led to the land of the setting sun, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>which lost itself in a region of crimson and gold. For
the sun went down to the level of the plain, and for a
moment appeared as the very gateway through which
at last the great road gave into enchanted regions.
Onward the youth sped gaily, light in his face, life in
his steps, the songs of the meadow-birds in his heart.
Some spell in the road drew him onward, or some
meaning wrought in him impelled him forward. Onward
he sped on the long upward road, and gained its
first incline as the sunset faded away. Then had the
horizon faded inward near him, and all became grey
and lonely as he gained the next incline, and then a
summit gained, the first summit giving view to further
slope and further crest. He now left the land of plains
and upward made his path, and only seldom descended
into valleys; but as night came on, and with night
wistfulness and loneliness, he looked about him where
he should find rest. He lay down in the grass by the
roadside, and the fresh odour in the grass brought back
the meadow thoughts, and a certain staleness and dustiness
came as sadness upon his heart. And as he lay
watching the starlight growing brighter in the grey sky,
he dreamed uneasily of the gay meadow and its flies
and bees, and of the red sunset-gate, and of something
appalling, though mysterious, there.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many days followed this day, and the youth had lain
on many banks of the same long dusty road, when one
afternoon a change came over him. He had tired early,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>for the noonday sun had been terrible, and the hot road
hard to his way-weary feet. He had lain among the
long fresh grasses beside a bush of the wild rose, and
had fallen asleep. Weary had he been, and the world
had seemed dull to him, the road ever the same, the sky
the same, village and town the same, and nowhere was
there beauty and freshness and new delight. Not
seven days a week were there for him but to-day, name
it what one would, eternally recurred. He fell asleep
among the grasses. But when he woke it was in a
surprise, for the world had changed. Away in the west
the sun had set mildly and a little moon had risen; a
tender night breeze was on the wing, and earliest moths
flitted from bush to tree. He awakened, or rather he
and himself awakened, a self below himself had
awakened, as if the soul had drawn curtains from two
windows after a long custom of drawing from only one.
A new being waking, blinked uneasily to find itself in
the swing and motion of life. “Who set me going?”
it asked, for it had power to ask questions that the
first being could not answer. The road stretched out an
eternity before and an eternity behind, but he knew not
why, and could give no answer to the questions: What
is the road? Whither leads the road? Whence comes
the road? Where did you begin to march upon it?
Why did you leave the meadow? To all these questions
answer such as could be given was forthcoming, and
was unsatisfactory enough withal. Long into night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>brooded the two beings together, and then for weariness
forgot and slept. And the next morn both awoke and
took this road, upon which his steps had become a
habit. Now all was thought and question, and the
youth found a new use for the wayfarers he met, and not
a tradesman or pilgrim or petty trafficker upon the road
but he put to him his questions concerning the destiny
which was at the end of the way. To most these questions
were too difficult. Not a few said there was no
answer, not a few said there was no question. Many
would have persuaded him that he sought a mere
shadow, a phantom, an illusion. Many bade him give
up the quest and settle upon the roadside in some town
or village. “Then I should be lost!” said the youth.
“For I have left a home which I can never find again,
in order that I may find a home which my heart tells me
shall be mine, and there is no rest for me till my mind
agrees with my heart.” Then on one occasion an old
pilgrim answered, “Knowest thou not, my son, that
this road leads eternally round the world? So long is it,
and so hard, that by old age thou canst only win back
to the sight of the land where thou wast once a child.
Be advised, quit the road where thou must always be a
seeker. Abandon thy quest, and settle here where the
pleasant stream gently flows under the red stone
bridge of the village. Thou wilt be lost, but thou wilt
sleep and forget, and one morning will find thee once
more the happiness lost in leaving the meadow.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Yet the youth pressed on, and the seasons passed
by, and the years rolled over with whites and greens and
reds and browns. Years passed, and still upon the
road the young man moved, and at length fewer people
appeared—fewer communities—less used and worn the
road appeared. One night he came to a hermit’s hut.
His old question he put to the hermit, but the latter
was a mocker. “Why is this road here; did not God
make it? Oh, my very young man, this road wasn’t
made by God—man made it; this is <i>the beaten track</i>,
the way man has followed man and sheep has followed
sheep through all time. This is the safest road round
the road and back again. The wheel of sunlight rolls
evenly along it, down over it in the west in the evening,
and up again in the east in the morning. To the sun
every inch of its road is known, and there are no discoveries
to be made upon it, no new things to be found.
Thou mightst have in the meadow learnt all its secrets
from the sun. But men find happiness along the road,
some in the hope of finding the new, others in foot-measuring
its miles, and some become happy resting by
the road, and settling there, and again others have their
joy in the nourishment of a secret hope of finding the
goal of the road. The sun provides the best happiness,
and does all the work that needs to be done, and from
mankind he has no need of help to rule the world. Be
not over anxious, my son, about goals and aims and
objects; they are only the vessels of happiness. And I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>counsel you, bethink you, now that the road becomes
more solitary, that your hope may become a burden or
may become too small. I also was of your spirit, and
persevered far along the road till I lost my hope and
had no means of happiness. In the hermit’s hut one
learns the art of being happy. One fashions the soul to
the deepest of all cups....”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the youth interrupted: “You have been along
the road, father! Tell me of that, for it is my road, and
nought can discourage me from my wish to know its end
and meaning.” The hermit smiled. “Soon you come
to a land of towers,” he said. “The towers were set up
by happy seekers; much time they spent in building,
and much secret happiness they gained thereby. Watch-towers
they are, and places of survey, besides many
league-stones and markers of progress. But really, now,
there are no more towers to be built, I think. Far as I
went along the road I found towers, and, indeed, nought
but towers at last. And ever as thou comest to a new
tower, thou, like myself long since, wilt climb the stairs
and take survey, and see a next tower—watch-towers
both—and from either only barren road and watch-tower
visible. These are not the profitable reaches of
the road of wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The morning after this the wanderer rose after calm
sleep. New hope was in his eyes, and a new thought
in his heart. “This is <i>the beaten track</i>,” he said, as he
stamped in the dust, and he was gay, though he knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>not the reason of his gaiety. Light of heart was he,
and happiness danced in his steps. But about noon
clouds came over the sky, and his gaiety gave way to a
new questioning and a new seriousness. He began to
see that he was coming to a more desolate country.
Naught was there before the eye but sky and road, and
then at length a first tower. Then he mounted to the
highest look-out and searched the land to the new
horizon, but the View was blank; only as a speck far
onward on the road he dimly made out the form of a
second tower. “I am weary of the road,” he said, as
he turned to descend the stairs, and when he had got
to the foot a confession was on his lips that the hermit
was right. Progress along the road was but vanity and
vexation of spirit. Now from sunset to dawn was a
desolate land of road and dust and towers all the way
from west to east. A strange weariness and anger
possessed his soul, and it happened that he saw a bank,
and feeling that all wish to go on had vanished he threw
himself down upon it. So he lay beside the road and
fought with despair and weariness. Far over the wide
country his eye wandered, but found no resting-place.
As the sun set stormily and angrily he looked away to
the north and scanned the sombre plain, and then restlessly
turned to the south. His heart brooded over
some wrong, and his mind sought some object to provoke
it to thought. His eye wandered over the desert
to the south, and settled on a soft purple line that lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the horizon. No window of the tower faced south,
or he might have been tempted to mount its steps once
more; for of a sudden the wrong was gone from his
heart, the seeking from his mind, and the restlessness
from his spirit. In place of these had come a new
energy, a new longing, a new love. Still he sat hesitating
by the bank, and suddenly new thoughts flooded
his mind as joy suffused his heart. “This <i>was</i> my
road; this <i>is</i> my road no longer. My heart brought me
so far, but I am no further tempted along its dust; now
towards the desert my heart yearneth. This is the
beaten track, and beyond this point I, too, would be
merely following, heartlessly helpless, like a loose stone
down the steep slope of time.” For awhile he dwelt in
the peace of his own heart. Then a sunbeam flashed
from beyond a cloud, and like a searchlight lit up the
way about him, and he saw what he had not discerned
before, that the road, though apparently one and continuous
away to the west, branched by an ill-defined
track away to the south also. Then the old magic
came back, and he knew that for him the true road was
this one diverging to the south, this unworn way, this
little-traversed path to the purple mountains.</p>

<hr class='c028' />

<p class='c013'>A youth steps forward on a new road and a horizon
goes forward. Sometimes slowly the horizon moves,
sometimes in leaps and bounds; slowly while mountain
is neared, suddenly when crests are achieved. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>enchantment which of old drew him from the meadow
to the hill, and from hill to highway, still goes before him,
enticing him forward. Life loves him and flees before
him, and as with the eyes of a woman looks out and
beckons him. She is the secret mistress of his heart;
as yet she is unknown, her love unrevealed, her mystery
and meaning unexplored.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over brown moors and mountains green the wanderer
clambers, and sighs his soul to the goal that for the present
stands before all others in the sky. Over the
ridges he passes and surmounts the rocks and passes
with light steps along the higher slopes, and then
arduously battles among crag and boulder, abyss and
great rock....</p>

<p class='c013'>And the conqueror is at last ascending the final
darkest, highest crag of all; only blackness is before
him, and adamantine rock. All horizon is gone; there
is no future but the future in his heart. Then suddenly
the worst becomes the best; the darkest the brightest;
the narrowest the widest; the shortest the furthest.
The conqueror stands with his foot upon the mountain’s
brow, and all the kingdoms of the world lie beneath him.
He has risen as a sun upon his own world, the dawn
whereby he sees his life has come. Now dwells he in the
eternal blue of ether, and looks down with pity to the
clouds below and the mists of fields and fogs of cities,
to the places where those live who did not believe in
their quests or in his. Now he learns the utmost limit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>of the meaning of human life, and he can renounce
beyond knowledge in his sufficiency. In nothing more
shall he ever be surprised. Life is revealed, the woman
who fled is won. Now is the horizon removed to its
utmost possibility—further than that grey-blue line he
cannot pass. He may descend the mountain, but the
horizon will narrow on—narrow in, and even though it
widen out again, and although he run his life’s journey
along the way, he will win no further than these, for that
is the shore of life itself, on which rolls the grey sea of
Death.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he descends into the plains, happiness remains
his, and the mountain vision remains in his heart. Life
has been revealed; now it shall be explored. Now he
shall learn in detail the mystery in each contribution of
each little plot to that grand mountain harmony that
flashed before his vision as he reaches his topmost peak.
He shall learn in detail the meaning of those distant
greys and blues. He may take what path he chooses—north
or east, or south or west; one path is his and
he will choose it. He may meet his old acquaintances
of the road, but will have no problems for them to
solve. He may see the old villages and cities, but without
impatience will he dwell in them, for he has the
satisfaction required.</p>

<p class='c013'>The youth stands and gazes, and all sinks into him.
Softly his eyes rest on the herds grazing in the valley,
on the great highway, on church and village, on many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>a green and brown and golden acre lying open to the full
kiss of the sky, and many a misty moor and jagged
sultry headland—looks over a long grey ridge marked
with steeples here and there, and beyond these, to new
blues and greys and purples. He measures life; the
present to the ultimate future, “the cloud-capped
towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the
great globe itself,” all these to the insubstantial pageant
fading in the sleep of dreams.</p>

<p class='c013'>I propose to write a few words on the facilities for
seeing the country in the hope that they may be of use
to some who think of touring there.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fare from London to Vladikavkaz is:</p>

<p class='c013'>Return tickets are available for sixty days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tickets cannot be taken right through, and it is
advisable to take them from London to Alexandrovo,
the Russian frontier, and thence to Vladikavkaz.
There are various companies which issue tickets for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Alexandrovo, the Great Eastern Railway Company, the
London, Chatham and Dover, and the Belgium States
Railway Company, 52 Gracechurch Street, E.C. The last-named
is the only company issuing third-class tickets.
It is as convenient to travel third as to travel second in
Belgium and Germany. In Russia, however, it is extremely
inconvenient to travel third class. The carriages
are dirty, and the passengers Russian peasants, and
the seats are wooden. First and second-class compartments
are very comfortable, and one may be
fairly sure of sleeping at night, since a ticket entitles
one to the whole length of a seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The train takes five days from Alexandrovo, with
changes at Warsaw (here one has to cross the town from
the Viensky to the Brestky Station, the fare for which
by droshky is one rouble), Kiev, Poltava and Rostof.
There is, however, a fast train, Warsaw-Rostof (first
and second class only), which enables one to do the
journey in two days less. A special ticket (platzkaart),
costing 10s., has to be bought at the Brestky Station,
Warsaw. The train leaves that station at 5.11
p.m.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another route is by train to Odessa (tickets may be
taken from London to Odessa), and thence by boat
to Novorossisk, Sukhum or Batum.</p>

<p class='c013'>Night accommodation at the post-stations is free,
except for a charge of 3d. or 4d. for linen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Instead of going by any of these conveyances one
may walk, and in that way the tourist will undoubtedly
see more of the country and of the people. Any passing
cart will give one a lift at the rate of about 12 miles for
6d. Food of a rough kind is obtainable at the <i>dukhans</i>,
of which there are hundreds; bread is 1¼d. (5 copecks)
a pound, and eggs (cooked) two a penny or less; wine,
1d. a glass; milk as in England; tea, <i>ad lib</i>, 2½d.; mutton,
2½d. a plate; chicken, 3d. or 4d. a plate. [A Russian
copeck corresponds to an English farthing, and a rouble
is 100 copecks and is approximately worth 2s.] For
a rouble one can get an ordinary hot Russian dinner at
the post stations. Tiflis hotels are on a level with those
of Vladikavkaz—the best is the <i>Vetsel</i>, with rooms from
one to eight roubles a day.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Trans-Caucasian railway runs from Tiflis to
Batum, a distance of three hundred miles, and passes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>through some of the most beautiful of the southern
country. It runs via Kutais, and this town is connected
with Vladikavkaz by a road two hundred miles
long, which one may travel partly by stage coach from
Kutais to Oni—110 versts, fare about six roubles.
The road onward is only open to traffic from June to
September, and there are no regular conveyances.
One can take a lineika for thirty roubles. The lineika
is a low jaunting car, having no protection either
against wind or rain. One sits sideways, and one’s feet
dangle beside the wheels. It has springs and is comfortable
enough in fine weather. It is the best vehicle
available on this road. The journey over the Mamison
Pass, 9281 feet high, may be extremely cold and
stormy, and it is advisable to start in the finest weather.
A snowstorm in midsummer is by no means unusual.
Near Lisri there is a by-road of extraordinary grandeur
to Kobi on the Georgian road.</p>

<p class='c013'>To see <i>Elbruz</i> it is best to go to Kislovodsk by rail
from Vladikavkaz (260 versts). Kislovodsk is the most
fashionable watering-place in Russia.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is extremely interesting to go by boat from
Novorossisk to Batum, calling at each of the thirteen
Caucasian ports on the Black Sea—Gilendzhik,
Dzhubra, Tuapse, Lazarevsky, Sochi, Adler, Gagri,
Gudaut, Novy Afon, Sukhum, Ochemchiri, Batum.</p>

<p class='c013'>From Sukhum there is a road to Kislovodsk, 300
versts, crossing the Klukhorsky Pass, 9600 feet high.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>One can generally obtain a conveyance at the rate of
three roubles a day, and the journey, if continuous,
would take about ten days. It is possible, however,
to do it in four days in a phaeton, and this would cost
not less than 100 roubles for the journey. In many
places this so-called road degenerates to a mere track
broken by rocks and overwashed by waterfalls. It is
certainly more convenient to drive than to walk in the
higher parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides these roads there are hundreds of tracks
leading to the fastnesses of the mountains, and these
are more or less difficult and wild. They can only be
explored by the horseman or the pedestrian, and the
former needs to have a sure seat. Horses may be hired
at £2 for the summer, or may be bought entirely at
prices ranging from £5 upwards. It may be mentioned,
however, that the natives, especially the Ingooshi, are
expert horse thieves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Russian is the only language of any value in the
Caucasus, and the tourist should know at least a
smattering of it. It is most important to realise that
the natives speak an extremely childish and simple
language that is easily understood. It is unnecessary
to know more than the elements of the language and a
good assortment of useful words. A Berlitz course, or
something similar, taught by a Russian teacher, is
probably the most useful. One should certainly carry
a pocket dictionary.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Much is said of the danger of travelling in the
Caucasus, especially by Russians, but there is truly
little danger. It is likely that an English traveller will
have queer adventures, but unlikely that he will come
to harm. I never took my revolver out once on my
tramps, but doubtless many people would feel more
secure with a weapon in their pocket. One thing may
be warned—keep out of the way of the police. The whole
police system of the Caucasus is corrupt, and innocent
or guilty, English or Russian, one is not likely to get
out of their hands easily. Permission to carry firearms
into Russia must be obtained through the Russian
Consul General in London, and application should be
made six weeks in advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The outfit may be best purchased in England, but
the black sheepskin cloaks worn by many people in the
Caucasus are extremely serviceable, being warm and
completely waterproof; they can be bought in the
towns for ten roubles. It is well to look passably well-dressed
on the road, as that ensures respect and courteous
treatment. Good manners help one immensely in any
difficulty. There is a sort of custom in Russia when
entering a shop to salute the shopkeeper and say
“Zdrast-vit-yé!” I, for my part, when tramping,
would always bow comprehensively to the shopkeeper
and the company in the shop—especially if it is an inn.</p>

<p class='c013'>On entering a shop, a Russian commonly inquires
the price of everything there, and the shopman doesn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>feel vexed if, after turning over all his wares, nothing is
bought. Whereas, if one merely buys a penny glass of
wine and drinks it politely, one is wished well on one’s
journey, the whole company is pleased, and when one
goes away the innkeeper says, “There goes an Englishman—a
fine man!”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
